In 2025, AI-powered coding platforms have rapidly moved from "nice to have " to an important part of modern developers. The tools that caught everyone's attention in these are Windsurf and Cursor.

It is hard to choose between the Windsurf vs cursor - they are mostly similar. They are both IDEs (integrated development environments) which are mostly developed for the vibe coders, i.e. non non-coders who build apps for fun and work. I have been using a cursor for a while now, but I spent little time on Windsurf to see how it works. In this blog, we are going to discuss what I have experienced.

## **Windsurf: The Lean AI That Gets Out of Your Hair**

Windsurf is designed to be a coding assistant, much like a great colleague who only interferes when needed. Windsurf is a local-first and privacy-focused AI that naturally integrates with your existing coding setup. As it resides entirely on your local machine, Windsurf eliminates cloud reliance and data leak concerns, allowing you to code freely without distractions.

### **Why is Windsurf Special?**

1. **Local-First:** Windsurf runs locally on your machine. Not only does this architecture make it fast and reliable, but it also ensures that your coding lifestyle and projects are confidential, as no data is transferred to third-party servers.
    
2. **Native Integration with VS Code:** We can integrate the windsurf with the Visual Studio Code. So you don\`t need to change the workflow. It comes with a dedicated VSCode so that you can use it.
    
3. **Privacy-First:** One of the most amazing features of Windsurf is its privacy-first nature. Code or confidential data never goes away from the local setup unless we explicitly choose to share it. This could be especially helpful for developers handling sensitive data or working in compliance environments.
    
4. **Context-Aware Recommendations:** It also provides context-aware code suggestions with respect to the local project files. Since it runs within your environment, it has direct access to the context of your work, which allows it to provide more meaningful and useful recommendations.
    

## **Cursor AI: The Powerhouse Copilot for Deep Collaboration**

[Cursor AI](https://keploy.io/blog/community/exploring-cursor-the-ai-code-editor-revolutionizing-development-productivity) takes an alternative route by being a cloud-based coding partner, engineered to supercharge collaboration. Imagine having a very capable AI collaborator working with you, especially useful for pair programming scenarios. Cursor AI is basically the most favourite AI tool for the vibe coders today.

### **What's the Buzz about Cursor?**

1. **Cloud-Native:** Leveraging the power of the cloud, Cursor AI is able to draw from powerful models and richer contextual insights. This setup makes it possible for the AI to operate using high compute power, which provides for a more immersive coding experience.
    
2. **Live Pair Programming:** Unlike simplistic auto-completion tools, Cursor AI works with pair programming in real time. It is able to reason with you, debug your code, and assist in building projects, so it is functionally very much like having a conversational partner while programming.
    
3. **Deep Project Context:** Cursor AI is in a position to manage large codebases comfortably. The ability to navigate different files without losing track suggests that it can realise the entire project structure and intricacies of big projects.
    
4. **Smart Navigation:** We can search, refactor, and document projects more effectively with project-wide AI intelligence using this. This enhances productivity through automated repetitive coding tasks.
    

## **The Face-Off: How They Stack Up**

Windsurf and Cursor AI are compared, and it is evident that both cater to different needs depending on individual needs and project needs.

* **Setup:** Windsurf comes with a fast, local setup, whereas Cursor AI has a cloud-based setup.
    
* **Privacy:** Windsurf offers full local privacy, whereas Cursor AI has data that is cloud-synced and therefore might be a problem for some users.
    
* **Real-Time Collaboration:** Real-time collaboration can be done only by Cursor AI, hence ideal for text-based team collaboration.
    
* **Offline Support:** Windsurf supports offline mode, providing smooth coding even without being connected to the internet, which is still a drawback in Cursor AI.
    
* **Context Handling:** Windsurf has a huge local project context, while Cursor AI uses the full project context along with its cloud feature.
    
* **Performance:** Windsurf can be super fast, latency-free on the network, which is unlike the performance of Cursor AI, which will be dependent on internet connectivity.
    
* **Ideal For:** Windsurf would be ideal for individual or privacy-oriented developers, while Cursor AI is perfect for teams or individuals working on intricate tasks.
    

## **When to Choose Windsurf**

You would maybe prefer using Windsurf when privacy is most important to you and you do not want to push any code to the cloud. If you need something easy, quick, and discreet, this tool would most probably be an excellent choice. It is especially convenient when used in local prototypes, side projects, or safe repositories where coding secrecy is paramount.

## **When to Choose Cursor AI**

If you like the idea of vibe coding, or if you're working on big, messy codebases where you need to have smart, project-level navigation, Cursor AI is a great option. It's best for teams who need to share context and take advantage of AI powers in a collaborative context.

## **Windsurf and cursor have well-matched values for the price**

Pricing for the AI coding assistance tools can be confusing-and they change daily depending on the users and popularity. But as I know, the price of a cursor and a windsurf is almost the same.

Windsurf offers a limited free plan that includes two two-week free trials and 25 credits per month. Windsurf pricing for pro starts at $15/month, which includes 500 prompts credit per month and the SWE-1 model. You can buy the windsurf for the team also, but it has different pricing.

Curso also offer a very limited free plan that includes a pro two-week trial also but it has limited agent response. It includes the Pro plan at 20$ per month, which includes unlimited agent requests and access to background agents. They also have the Ultra Plan, which is at 200$ per month, which includes 20x usage on all OpenAI, Claude, and Gemini models.

The core product manager of WooCommerce made a great point about the pricing of these tools. He said that: "I think Cursor's pricing is fair for the value it provides, especially when used as the core IDE. It effectively turns AI from a helpful assistant into a true project partner, which is hard to put a price on.

That said, I do think the real value depends on how deep you go with it—if you only use it occasionally, the cost might feel steep. But as a daily driver, it's well worth it for me"

I used the cursor AI for free as the cursor is free for students, but not in INDIA. The cost of AI models is increasing day by day, so I won\`t be surprised if the costs go high in the upcoming year, as people are preferring the vibe coding more.

## **The Bigger Picture**

As we know, AI agents are coming every day with new features, which is looking like a great shift to the non coding. With your local AI's privacy advantage or your cloud-based tool's collaboration power, these AI friends are breaking the coding struggle. They increase your productivity, enable quicker bug detection, and even provide more efficient design patterns.

## **Conclusion**

After using both agents and seeing all of the features and future possibilities, I'm going with Cursor as my primary IDE for vibe coding. I find it to have an overall better "quality of life" when using it, especially as a non-developer. But I will keep playing with Windsurf beyond this initial test because of what I can see in the features they're actively developing.

Ok, but which app should you choose: Windsurf or Cursor?

I recommend testing out both to see which one better fits your vibe. Cursor has a more active user base and resources to find support in, but Windsurf has some innovative features that are worth getting to know.  It doesn\`t matter what you choose; you can build something cool with both tools.
