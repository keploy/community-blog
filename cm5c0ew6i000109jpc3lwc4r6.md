Imagine you're testing a specific feature in an app, say the login page. You've already run your test cases, and things look fine, but you want to go further. What if you hammer this one feature repeatedly, trying to break it by using unexpected inputs or extreme scenarios?

Gorilla testing is an approach that is preferred when we are trying to understand in depth about a particular functionality. This saves a lot of time for cases through which developers can discover specific edge cases and uncover hidden bugs

## What is Gorilla Testing?

Gorilla testing emphasizes intensive and repeated testing of a specific module or feature within an application. This method is handy for identifying defects and ensuring the reliability of critical functionalities before the software is released to users.

## **What is the Importance of Gorilla Testing?**

In software development, gorilla testing is crucial for several reasons.

* **Critical Feature Validation**: In high-stakes sectors like healthcare and aviation, critical feature validation enables teams to thoroughly test crucial features that if not validated could be flawed, which has a business impact directly
    
* **Defect Discovery**: It helps find hidden issues that larger testing phases would overlook. This targeted strategy raises the possibility of finding important problems before deployment.
    
* **Stress Testing**: This technique simulates harsh environments and unforeseen user behaviors by pushing software components to their limits. This aids in evaluating the application's performance and stability under pressure.
    
* **Resource Efficiency**: It can save time and resources by eliminating needless testing of non-essential aspects because it focuses on specific functionalities, enabling teams to concentrate their efforts where they are most needed.
    
* **Improved Quality Assurance**: It's repeating nature guarantees that any flaws discovered are not the result of chance, which raises the software product's overall quality.
    

## What is Monkey Testing?

Monkey testing provides random inputs to an application without following any predefined test cases. The primary goal is to uncover critical bugs and vulnerabilities by simulating unpredictable user behavior. This method is inspired by the **Infinite Monkey Theorem**, which suggests that a monkey randomly hitting keys on a typewriter will eventually produce any given text.

## **What are the Features of Monkey Testing?**

* **Randomized Inputs**: Testers apply random inputs and actions to the software, which helps in identifying unexpected defects that structured testing might miss
    
* **Unstructured Approach**: There is no specific test plan or strategy, allowing testers to simulate erratic user behavior freely. This unpredictability can expose hidden issues in the application
    
* **Types of Testing**: It can be categorized into:
    
    * **Dumb Monkey Testing**: Testers do not know the application and provide random inputs without understanding its functionality. This can reveal significant bugs that might be overlooked by more knowledgeable testers
        
    * **Smart Monkey Testing**: Testers possess some understanding of the application and strategically input invalid data to identify vulnerabilities while aiming to break the system
        
* **Stress Testing**: This technique is effective for stress testing applications, particularly in mobile environments, as it evaluates how well software can handle random and intense user interactions
    

## Difference Between Gorilla Testing and Monkey Testing

| ***Aspect*** | ***Monkey Testing*** | ***Gorilla Testing*** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Focus** | Random and broad, testing the application as a whole. | Narrow and deep, focusing on a single module or functionality. |
| **Objective** | To identify unexpected crashes and random bugs across the application. | To validate the robustness and reliability of a specific module under repetitive and extreme conditions. |
| **Approach** | Unstructured and exploratory; testers may not follow predefined test cases. | Repetitive and concentrated; testers repeatedly test one area to stress-test it. |
| **Test Coverage** | Covers a wide range of scenarios but may not go deep into any single functionality. | Highly detailed for the targeted module, but ignores the rest of the application. |
| **Execution Style** | Simulates random, unplanned actions like those of an unpredictable user. | Simulates exhaustive testing by focusing on edge cases and high-stress scenarios for one component. |
| **Tools** | Often relies on tools to simulate random user behavior (e.g., chaos testing tools). | Can be manual or automated with repetitive test scripts targeting the module. |

## Gorilla vs. Monkey Testing: Which Approach Fits Your Needs?

| ***Scenario*** | ***Use Gorilla Testing*** | ***Use Monkey Testing*** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Purpose** | To thoroughly test a critical or fragile feature. | To simulate random user interactions across the application. |
| **Stage in Development** | Later stages, once the feature is mostly stable and needs rigorous testing. | [Early stages](https://keploy.io/blog/community/4-ways-to-accelerate-your-software-testing-life-cycle), to identify unforeseen crashes or misbehaviors. |
| **Nature of Testing** | Focused and repetitive on one module. | Broad and exploratory, covering the whole application. |
| **Example Use Case** | Testing the login functionality with various combinations. | Testing an app to see how it behaves under completely random user actions. |

### Gorilla Testing (Focused and Repetitive)

Here, we repeatedly test the login function with different input combinations.

```python
# Example
class App:
    def login(self, username, password):
        # Simulate a basic login function
        if username == "user1" and password == "correctpassword":
            return {"status_code": 200, "message": "Login successful"}
        elif username and password:
            return {"status_code": 401, "message": "Unauthorized"}
        else:
            return {"status_code": 400, "message": "Bad Request"}

# Implementation
def gorilla_test_login():
    app = App()
    credentials = [
        ("user1", "correctpassword"),  # Valid login
        ("user1", "wrongpassword"),    # Invalid password
        ("", "nopassword"),            # Missing username
        ("user1", ""),                 # Missing password
        ("user<script>", "pass123"),   # Malicious input
    ]

    for username, password in credentials:
        response = app.login(username, password)
        print(f"Testing with username='{username}' and password='{password}'")
        print(f"Response: {response}")
        assert response is not None, "Response should not be None"
        if username == "user1" and password == "correctpassword":
            assert response["status_code"] == 200, "Valid credentials should succeed"
        else:
            assert response["status_code"] in [400, 401], "Invalid credentials should fail"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Running Gorilla Testing...")
    gorilla_test_login()
```

### Monkey Testing: Random Actions on an App

This example randomly tests an app by simulating user interactions.

```python
# Example
import random

class App:
    def click_button(self, button):
        print(f"Clicked on button: {button}")
        return True

    def enter_text(self, field, text):
        print(f"Entered '{text}' in field: {field}")
        return True

    def swipe(self, direction):
        print(f"Swiped {direction}")
        return True

    def scroll(self, direction):
        print(f"Scrolled {direction}")
        return True

# Implementation
def monkey_test_app():
    app = App()
    actions = ["click_button", "enter_text", "swipe", "scroll"]

    for _ in range(20):  # Simulate 20 random actions
        action = random.choice(actions)
        if action == "click_button":
            app.click_button(f"button_{random.randint(1, 10)}")
        elif action == "enter_text":
            app.enter_text(f"field_{random.randint(1, 5)}", ''.join(random.choices("abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", k=8)))
        elif action == "swipe":
            app.swipe(random.choice(["up", "down", "left", "right"]))
        elif action == "scroll":
            app.scroll(random.choice(["up", "down"]))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Running Monkey Testing...")
    monkey_test_app()
```
