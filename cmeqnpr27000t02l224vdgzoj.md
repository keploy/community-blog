You will encounter debugging while developing backend systems, web applications, or automation scripts - it's an inevitable step in the development life cycle. Debugging is a necessary step preceding any delivery of a software product. The Python ecosystem academic is different in that you may not see your errors until you are running the code.

Having a stable way to debug your [Python code](https://keploy.io/blog/community/prompt-engineering-for-python-code-generation-with-keploy) is very important for continuing your development journey. Luckily, as a developer, probably one of the best possible setups you could have is VSCode Python Debugger.

In this guide, you will learn how to set up and use the VSCode debug environment, explore a typical Python debug flow, and learn how to avoid some common pitfalls that can slow down your development.

## **Why Use VSCode for Python Debugging?**

![Use VSCode for Python Debugging](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1755164564863/2ebb5e8d-b014-4d1f-80ae-797f72de11ee.png align="center")

VSCode has undoubtedly become the code editor of choice among developers for speed and capabilities. Below are some of the reasons it excels for Python debugging:

* Lightweight by design, heavyweight by capabilities
    
* Microsoft Python extension: Smart code completion (IntelliSense), code linting, and debugger support
    
* Git and integrated terminal
    
* Cross-platform capabilities
    

### **More Context and** Comparison with **Other** **Tools**

* PyCharm is powerful but resource-heavy
    
* Jupyter Notebooks are great for Data Science, but not debugging apps
    
* Atom/Sublime do not provide debugging capabilities out of the box
    

## **Configuring** the VSCode **debugger** **for Python**

1. **Download Visual Studio Code**
    
2. **Download** the **Microsoft** Python extension
    
3. Select your **python** interpreter (Ctrl+Shift+P → **"Python: Select Interpreter"**)
    
4. **If you would like to, you can** install debugpy, pdb, or ipdb
    
5. Activate your virtual environment, if **applicable**
    

## **Creating Your First Debug Configuration**

In order to further customize your debugging sessions, you will need a launch.json file under the .vscode folder.

### **Configuring** **a** **launch file:**

* **Go to** the Debug tab (Run and Debug)
    
* Click “Create a launch.json file”
    
* **When prompted, select** “Python”
    

### **Example**

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Python: Current File",
      "type": "python",
      "request": "launch",
      "program": "${file}",
      "console": "integratedTerminal",
      "args": ["--example", "value"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Debugging Python **Code** **Using** VSCode

To get started debugging, hit **F5** or click the green **"Run"** button.

### **Essential** **Features** of **Debug** **Interface**

* **Breakpoints**
    
* **Step in / step over / step out**
    
* **Variable explorer**
    
* **Call stack**
    
* **Watch window**
    
* **Hover inspection**
    
* **Debug console (for live evaluations)**
    

### Using Breakpoints to **debug** **like** a **pro**

#### Breakpoint features:

* Add / remove a breakpoint with F9 or by using the "Breakpoint" icon in the sidebar.
    
* Set conditional breakpoints (e.g.: x &gt; 10).
    
* Create logpoints where you can print messages to the output without stopping the execution.
    
* Set temporary breakpoints.
    
* Set hit counts: break after hitting the breakpoint a certain number of times.
    

### Advanced Debugging Techniques

#### Debugging remotely

* Utilize debugpy.listen()
    
* Connect via **Remote SSH**
    

#### Flask / Django applications

* Use "args": \["runserver"\] or "django": true in your config
    

#### Multithreaded debugging

* See all threads in the **call stack**
    
* Very useful for yours, background jobs and **asyncio**
    

#### Attaching to processes

* Attach to already running scripts or services
    

#### Debugging unit tests

* Integrate with [**pytest** or **unittest**](https://keploy.io/blog/community/difference-between-pytest-and-unittest)
    
* By running it in the **Testing** tab or creating a debug configuration for your tests
    

### Debugging Jupyter Notebooks in VSCode

* Use %debug in a code cell
    
* Click the debug icon in the top-right corner
    
* You can see the call stack and variables, the same way as if you were debugging a script.
    

## **Command Palette & Keyboard Shortcuts**

Boost productivity with key bindings:

* F5: Start debugging
    
* F9: Toggle breakpoint
    
* F10: Step over
    
* F11: Step into
    
* Shift+F11: Step out
    
* Ctrl+Shift+D: Open debug panel
    
* Ctrl+Shift+P: Access Command Palette
    

### Common Python Debugging Errors in VSCode & **Solutions**

**Breakpoints not hitting**  
If breakpoints are not being hit, ensure you have saved your file, selected the correct Python interpreter and that you have configured the debugger properly.

**Debugger not starting**  
If the debugger is not starting, check your launch.json file for mistakes and verify that you have correctly installed the Python extension and debugger.

**Path-related errors**  
If your script cannot find files or directories, change your "cwd" (current working directory) in your debugger configuration file.

**Environment variables not loading**  
Ensure your config includes `"envFile": "${workspaceFolder}/.env"` to load variables correctly from a `.env` file.

### Best **Strategies** for Debugging Python in VSCode

* **Make use of logging rather than print statements**  
    Logging will give you many more options, and control while keeping your debug output clean and structured.
    
* **Add a linter like** `pylint` or `flake8`  
    Linters catch regular problems before you even run the code saving time and effort with debugging later.
    
* **Write tests before debugging**  
    Unit tests allow you to dial in on the source of the bug quickly to also help minimize regressions.
    
* **Break your code into smaller functions or modules**  
    Modular code will be easier to reason about, test, and debug when things go wrong.
    
* **Use** `.env` **files to manage your configurations**  
    Drill down your environment variables so they do not live in every codebase while maintaining consistency while debugging.
    

## **Bonus: Debugging in Containers and Virtual Environments**

* Use **Remote - Containers** extension for Docker
    
* Attach debugger to running container via `debugpy`
    
* For WSL, activate the right environment in terminal
    
* Always ensure the correct interpreter is selected
    

## **Conclusion**

Using the vscode Python Debugging will help you maintain the hero status of debugging your Python code. With all its features, breakpoints, variable tracking and interaction with all your Git and terminal, it is an invaluable tool for any modern-day Python developer.

You no longer have to rely on print statements to debug your Python code, and you are now able to debug with higher quality. Especially when you pair VSCode with some smart tools like Keploy.

## **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)**

### What is the VSCode Python Debugger?

VSCode Python Debugger is an integrated tool for Microsoft Visual Studio Code to enable you to inspect your Python code step by step, set breakpoints, inspect variables, and find issues without placing a bunch of print statements in your code!

### How do I get started debugging in VSCode for Python?

First, install the Microsoft Python Extension. You then have to load your Python file, and click on F5 or "Run and Debug" button. If you'd like to get more granular control, you can create a .vscode/launch.json file to customize your debugging configuration.

### Why aren't my breakpoints working in VSCode?

Some reasons your breakpoints might not be hit is: You happen not to save your file, the Python interpreter you selected is wrong, or you didn't launch your script via the debugger. You must make sure your file is saved and that you launch your app with the debug configuration.

### Can I debug a Flask or Django application in VSCode?

Yes! You need to set "django": true in your launch.json configuration for Django. For Flask, you just add your app.py under "program" as well as "args": \["run"\]. Both activities are fully supported in VSCode proper debugging launch.json setup.

### What are **some** best -known practices for Python debug in VSCode?

Take advantage of loggers instead of standard print statements, write your tests earlier rather than later, split up your code into functions/modules, enable linters such as pylint, and don't forget to use conditional breakpoint and watch expressions to speed up your debugging.
