HTTP status codes play a crucial role in web communication, providing vital information about the outcome of requests made to servers. From resolving issues to optimizing performance, mastering these codes can significantly enhance your debugging skills and streamline web development.

This guide will break down the most common [<mark>HTTP status codes</mark>](https://keploy.io/blog/community/decoding-http2-traffic-is-hard-but-ebpf-can-help)<mark>, </mark> explaining what they mean and how to handle them effectively.

## [What is HTTP](https://keploy.io/blog/community/understanding-http-and-https-as-a-beginner)?

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the backbone of data communication on the World Wide Web. It is an application layer protocol that defines how clients (like web browsers) request resources (such as web pages or files) from servers, and how servers respond.

HTTP’s primary features include:

1. **Stateless Protocol:** Each client-server request is independent, meaning the server doesn’t retain information about previous requests.
    
2. **Client-Server Model:** HTTP operates through a client-server model where clients initiate requests, and servers process and return responses.
    
3. **Text-Based Protocol:** HTTP messages are human-readable and transmitted over TCP/IP, typically on port 80 (or 443 for HTTPS).
    
4. **Request Methods:** HTTP defines several methods like GET (retrieve data), POST (submit data), PUT (update data), and DELETE (remove data).
    
5. **Status Codes:** HTTP responses include status codes indicating the result of a request, such as **200 OK** for success or **404 Not Found** for missing resources.
    
6. **Versioning:** From HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/3 (also known as QUIC), HTTP has evolved to improve speed and security.
    

These characteristics make http code essential for the seamless retrieval of data across the internet.

## The Breakdown of HTTP Status Codes

HTTP status codes are divided into five categories: Informational, Success, Redirection, Client Errors, and Server Errors. Each class provides insights into how a request was processed.

![Breakdown of HTTP Status Codes](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1758109401309/19cd848a-87fd-4a9f-8102-223aad8c0416.png align="center")

### 1xx **Informational** Codes

1xx codes are Informational Responses. The 1xx class of HTTP status codes is often overlooked in day-to-day web development, but they play a crucial role in the communication between a client and a server. These codes indicate that the server has received the request and is continuing the process.

* **100 Continue**: The initial part of a request has been received, and the client should continue with the rest of the request.
    
* **101 Switching Protocols**: The server is changing protocols as requested by the client.
    
* **102 Processing (WebDAV)**: Inform the client that the server has accepted the complete request but has not yet completed it.
    

### 2xx **Success** Codes

2xx codes are known as Successful Responses. These status codes tell the client that the request was successfully received, understood, and accepted by the server.

* **200 OK**: The request was successful. This is the most common status code and means the server returned the requested data.
    
* **201 Created**: The request was successful, and a new resource was created. This is often seen in response to POST requests.
    
* **204 No Content**: The server successfully processed the request, but there is no content to send back. Useful when updating resources without needing to return updated data.
    

### 3xx Redirection Code

3xx status codes are Redirection Messages. These codes indicate that the client must take additional actions to complete the request.

* **301 Moved Permanently**: The requested resource has been permanently moved to a new URL. Clients should use the new URL in future requests.
    
* **302 Found**: The resource is temporarily located at a different URL. Clients should continue to use the original URL.
    
* **304 Not Modified**: The resource has not been modified since the last request. This helps save bandwidth and improve performance by using cached versions of resources.
    

### 4xx Client Code

Client Error Responses are identified by 4xx status codes. These codes indicate that there was an error with the request made by the client.

* **400 Bad Request:** The server cannot process the request due to malformed syntax or invalid data.
    
* **401 Unauthorized:** The request requires user authentication, typically prompting a login.
    
* **403 Forbidden:** The server understands the request but refuses to authorize it, often due to insufficient permissions.
    
* **404 Not Found:** The server cannot find the requested resource, commonly seen when a URL is incorrect or the page no longer exists.
    
* **422 Unprocessable Entity:** The server understands the request but cannot process it, often due to semantic errors in the request content.
    
* **429 Too Many Requests:** The client has made too many requests in a short time, triggering rate limiting.
    
* **<mark>443 status code.</mark>**
    

### 5xx Server Error Code

The HTTP status codes in the **5xx category** are associated with problems where the server recognizes the request is valid but did not fulfill it. These are more related to server problems than client problems, and usually involve server **debugging, configuration changes, or scaling issues.**

* **500 - Internal Server Error**
    
    **Meaning:** A general error that occurs when the server is unaware of how to handle a request, due to an unexpected error.
    
* **Causes:**
    
    * Unhandled exceptions in code on the server-side
        
    * Misconfigured settings on the server-side (e.g., Apache, NGINX, PHP)
        
    * Incorrect rules within the .htaccess file
        
* **Examples in web frameworks:**
    
    In **Node.js (Express)**, for example, if an error is thrown and there is no catch block, then typically a 500 will result.
    
* **Fixes:**
    
    * Check error logs (error.log / application logs)
        
    * Enabled proper exception handling and error reporting
        
    
    **501 - Not Implemented**
    
    * **Meaning:** The server does not support the functionality required to process the request.
        
    * **Typical Scenario:**
        
        * A client sends a request using an HTTP method (e.g., PATCH, PUT) that the server doesn’t support.
            
    * **Fix:**
        
        * Ensure API endpoints and request methods are implemented correctly.
            
    
    #### **502 - Bad Gateway**
    
    * **Meaning:** A server that is acting as a gateway/proxy has received an invalid response from the upstream server.
        
    * **Causes:**
        
        * Timeout in upstream server (e.g., microservice not responding)
            
        * Network/DNS errors
            
        * Load balancer misconfiguration
            
    * **Real Example:**
        
        * Cloudflare often returns a 502 if the origin server fails to respond correctly.
            
    * **Fix:**
        
        * Check upstream service health
            
        * Verify load balancer settings
            
    
    #### **503 - Service Unavailable**
    
    * **Meaning:** The server cannot handle requests temporarily (usually because it is overloaded or down for maintenance).
        
    * **Best Practice:**
        
        * Use the Retry-After header in the response so the client knows when to retry the request.
            
    * **Fix:**
        
        * Scale server resources
            
        * Optimize server performance
            
        * Show a user-friendly maintenance page
            
    
    #### **504 - Gateway Timeout**
    
    * **Meaning:** The gateway or proxy server did not receive a response in time from the upstream server.
        
    * **Common Causes:**
        
        * Slow API response
            
        * Long-running database queries
            
    * **Fix:**
        
        * Optimize queries
            
        * Increase timeout limits if necessary
            
        * Use caching where possible
            
    
    #### **505 - HTTP Version Not Supported**
    
    * **Meaning:** The server does not support the HTTP protocol version used in the request (e.g., HTTP/1.0, HTTP/2).
        
    * **Fix:**
        
        * Update server to support newer HTTP protocols
            
        * Ensure clients are using compatible versions
            
    
    #### **507 - Insufficient Storage (WebDAV)**
    
    * **Meaning:** The server cannot store the representation needed to complete the request.
        
    * **Use Case:** Seen in WebDAV-related services and storage APIs.
        
    
    #### **508 - Loop Detected (WebDAV)**
    
    * **Meaning:** The server detected an infinite loop while processing the request.
        
    * **Fix:**
        
        * Debug recursive calls or misconfigured server redirects
            
    
    #### **510 - Not Extended**
    
    * **Meaning:** The server requires further extensions to fulfill the request.
        
    * **Example:** Used when a request must include additional parameters/options not defined in the standard HTTP request.
        
    
    #### **511 - Network Authentication Required**
    
    * **Meaning:** The client must authenticate to gain network access (e.g., Wi-Fi login portals).
        
    * **Example:** Captive portals in hotels, airports, and public networks often trigger this.
        
        ### **🔍 Best Practices for Handling 5xx Errors**
        
    * **Monitor:** Use tools like **Datadog, New Relic, or Sentry** for real-time error tracking.
        
    * **Log Everything:** Store stack traces and request details to trace root causes.
        
    * **Fallbacks:** Implement graceful degradation (e.g., show cached content if upstream API fails).
        
    * **User-Friendly Messages:** Replace raw server errors with branded error pages that guide users.
        
    
    **Retry Logic:** For APIs, use exponential backoff for retries when 503 or 504 occurs.
    

## **Handling HTTP Status Codes**

Understanding these status codes is vital for both frontend and backend developers. Here are some tips on handling them effectively:

1. **Logging and monitoring**
    
    Tracking HTTP status codes is essential for debugging and monitoring. By logging codes, especially errors like **500 Internal Server Error** and **422 Unprocessable Entity**, you can detect and resolve issues before they escalate.
    
2. **User-Friendly Messages**
    
    When handling client-side errors (4xx codes), display user-friendly messages. For instance, replace "404 Not Found" with a custom message like “The page you’re looking for doesn’t exist.” <mark>These are all http error code.</mark>
    
3. **Retry Logic**
    
    For certain server-side errors (5xx codes), implement retry logic. Temporary errors like **502 Bad Gateway** or **503 Service Unavailable** may resolve if retried after a few seconds.
    
4. **Security Considerations**
    
    For status codes like **401 Unauthorized** and **403 Forbidden**, ensure you handle sensitive data securely. Properly authenticate and authorize users to protect restricted resources.
    
5. **Handling Rate Limits**
    
    When clients hit rate limits, respond with **429 Too Many Requests** and use headers like `Retry-After` to inform when they can try again. This helps manage server load while providing a clear user experience.
    

## ✅ Conclusion

HTTP status codes are signals, not just numerical values, about the status of your web applications and how to respond to them. With deeper insights into what these codes reveal as well as how to respond, developers can:

* Debug problems more quickly
    
* Create more robust, usable applications
    
* Optimize performance and server response
    

Whether you’re troubleshooting errors, such as **404** and 500 status codes, or configuring redirects (**301, 302**), the codes are always the **first step** in determining how clients and servers communicate.

> In other words, mastering **status codes** will make you a better problem solver as a developer.

## **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)**

### Q1. What is the HTTP status code "404 Not Found"? What do I do if I see that when I visit a site?

The server could not find the resource requested by the server. In general, this error will occur if the URL is incorrect or if the page has been removed. You can remedy this issue by checking for typos, verifying the resource exists, and preparing **301 redirects** for all moved content.

### Q2. What is the reason for getting a "500 Internal Server Error," and how can it be resolved?

A "500 Internal Server Error" simply means something happened on the server, and your code is not at fault. Confirm the cause by debugging with either/or both methods below:

1. Review server logs for details on the error.
    
2. Check to see what code or configuration you have changed lately.
    
3. Verify that dependencies and resources are up and accessible.
    

### Q3. What should I do if I get a "401 Unauthorized" error?

This error means authentication is required, so you will need to make sure the user is authenticated before accessing this restricted area. You can do this securely by implementing strategies like using tokens, OAuth, or JWT, and make sure you are verifying the user permissions.

### Q4. What does a "302 Found" status code signify, and when **to** **use** **it**?

It represents a temporary reroute. You should use this status code when you put a content temporarily and it is also available at another URL. When the content is permanently redirected always use **301 Moved** Permanently.

### Q5. What are the best practices for addressing the "429 Too Many Requests"?

This response occurs when clients have sent too many requests in a short time frame. Some recommendations include:

* Implementing rate limiting
    
* Adding Retry-After headers
    
* Returning a clear error message to the user with information regarding when to retry.
