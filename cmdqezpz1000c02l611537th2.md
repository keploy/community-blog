In the constantly changing landscape of software development, shipping features fast and consistently is a must. **Automated testing** is one of the central pillars that enable this agility. And for writing solid, scalable, and comprehensible automated tests, Python is a go-to for both developers and QA engineers alike.

This blog discusses all there is to know about **Python Automation Testing** - what it is, **types of automated testing**, why Python is suited for this, how to do it in a step-by-step manner, and which tools (such as **Keploy**) can simplify your work.

## What is Automated Testing?

[**Automated testing**](https://keploy.io/blog/community/guide-to-automated-testing-tools-in-2025) is the process of employing tools or scripts to automatically confirm that the software behaves as expected. Rather than performing manual checks for functions or pages, you create test cases once and execute them each time code is modified.

This not only avoids human errors but also streamlines **regression testing** and **continuous integration** significantly.

## Types of Automated Testing

![Types of Automated Testing](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1747123576065/e36bd5f3-a41b-4435-a75c-d9e846f27625.png align="center")

### 1\. Unit Testing

[Unit testing](https://keploy.io/blog/community/what-is-unit-testing) is the practice of testing isolated units of code, like functions or methods, independent of the rest of the application. The goal is to verify that a specific piece of logic works independently.

**Example:** Let's say you have a function add(a, b) that sums two numbers and returns the value. A unit test would verify if add(2, 3) returns 5 every time.

**Why it matters:**

* Identifies bugs early during the development phase.
    
* Ensures that separate pieces of code function as expected.
    
* Easy to automate and fast to run.
    

**Python Tool:** pytest, unittest

### 2\. Integration Testing

[Integration testing](https://keploy.io/blog/community/all-about-system-integration-testing-in-software-testing) ensures each piece of your application gets along with one another. It is all about communication between modules, services, databases, or outside APIs.

**Example:** You have an API /users that is fetching details of a user from a database. An integration test would confirm that this endpoint fetches and provides details about a user appropriately upon a successful database query.

**Why it matters:**

* Guarantees there is seamless communication between components.
    
* Helps in bug identification due to module compatibility modifications.
    

**Python tool:** pytest, Keploy (capturing and replaying live API calls, including database queries)

### 3\. Functional Testing

[Functional testing](https://keploy.io/blog/community/functional-testing-unveiling-types-and-real-world-applications) is all about ensuring your software satisfies the specified business requirements or specifications. It confirms what the system accomplishes and not how it accomplishes it.

**Example:** A functional test would confirm whether after a user clicks on the "Login" button after the provision of correct credentials, he/she is taken to his/her dashboard.

**Why it matters:**

* Confirms the product behaves as expected by the user.
    
* Resolves simple business functionalities.
    

**Tool in Python:** pytest, Robot Framework, Behave (for functional testing in BDD-fashion)

### 4\. Regression Testing

[Regression testing](https://keploy.io/blog/community/regression-testing-tools-rankings-2025) is what **saves changes to code from breaking** something that once worked. It runs existing working tests so as to ensure that everything continues to work when something has been altered.

**Example:** You add a referral field to your signup. A regression test would re-run login, signup, and create-profile tests to ensure they still function the same way as they once did.

**Why it matters:**

* Avoids introducing new bugs.
    
* Critical to maintaining software stability in heavy development workloads.
    

**Python tool:** pytest (totally fantastic at running whole suites of tests automatically), Keploy (replay of recorded API calls as tests)

### 5\. End-to-End (E2E) Testing

[E2E testing](https://keploy.io/blog/community/exploring-the-effectiveness-of-e2e-testing-in-comparison-with-integration-testing) validates the end-to-end application flow, replicating real user action from start to finish. It checks out the entire system - from UI right down to the database.

**Example:** An end-to-end test can replicate a user visiting your site, signing up with email, email verification, logging in, viewing products, adding to cart, and purchasing.

**Why it matters:**

* Ensures proper functioning of the application in a production environment-like environment.
    
* Identifies bugs that occur only in end-to-end workflows.
    

**Python tools:** Selenium (browser automation), Playwright, Robot Framework.

## What is Python Automation Testing?

Python automation testing is a process of using Python to generate automatically test scripts to check an application's functionality. You can automate testing APIs, web applications, or even microservices with Python and libraries and tools at your disposal to automatically automate all the layers of testing.

**Real Example: Using Keploy for API Testing**

* **Keploy** logs API calls and automatically creates test cases and mocks based on them, without requiring writing manual unit or integration tests. Here is an example:
    

```python
keploy record --path ./your_app
```

* Run your application as usual, and Keploy records the requests and responses in order to create test cases you can replay afterwards.
    
* This comes in particularly handy in microservice environments where mocking dependencies and making it reproducible is a must.
    

## Why Use Python for Automated Testing?

Python isn't a beginner's language - it's a leader's language of choice for automated testing because of its broad ecosystem and easy-to-read syntax.

![Python for Automated Testing](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1747051421387/2bdf190e-655a-449b-9f7d-5f281176774f.png align="center")

Below are the reasons why using Python is superior:

* **Elegant and readable syntax â€“** Test writing is second nature.
    
* **Support for broad libraries â€“** From unit tests (`pytest`) to E2E (`Selenium`), Python has you covered.
    
* **Strong community and documentation** â€“ Simple to look for assistance and discover answers.
    
* **Smooth integration** with CI/CD pipelines for automate.
    
* **Mocking, coverage reports, and assertions support.**
    

Even non-coding testers can write good test suites with Python.

## How to Automate Testing with Python?

Let's go through a basic process of installing and executing Python-based automated tests:

### ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

* Ensure that Python has been installed. Install libraries such as `pytest` and `keploy`:
    

```python
pip install pytest
```

### ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Write Your First Unit Test

```python
# app.py
def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b

# test_app.py
from app import multiply

def test_multiply():
    assert multiply(3, 4) == 12
```

* Run tests using:
    

```python
pytest test_app.py
```

### ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Automate API Testing with Keploy

* Begin recording test data:
    

```python
keploy record --path ./your_app
```

* Work on your app (with Postman, frontend, etc.), and Keploy captures API calls and results.
    
* Then test with
    

```python
keploy test --path ./your_app
```

* No more typing: Keploy writes it for you.
    

### ðŸ”¹ Step 4: CI/CD Integration

Automated testing on every pull request by:

* **GitHub Actions**
    
* **GitLab CI/CD**
    
* **Jenkins**
    

Sample GitHub Action code snippet:

```python
name: Run Tests
on: [push]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: Run tests
        run: pytest
```

### pytest

**pytest** is likely the most popular test tool in Python. pytest can manage everything from simple **unit tests** to **complex functional testing**, all thanks to its robust features like fixtures, parameterization, and plugins. It's also extremely simple to use - test names follow a simple convention (test\_) and assertions need no boilerplate code.

**Example:** pytest-django and pytest-flask are typical plugins for web application testing.

### unittest

As Python's native testing framework, **unittest** is JUnit-influenced. It's widely known to respect object-oriented tests well and coexists well with test runners in IDEs like PyCharm. Though it requires more boilerplate than pytest, it's reliable and does integrate with CI/CD tools.

### Selenium

**Selenium** allows you to test actual browsers using Python code, which makes it a top pick for **UI and end-to-end tests**. Selenium can automate clicks, form submission, page navigation, and more - why it's the standard choice for web automaton.

**Example:** Automating Chrome, Firefox, and Edge login/logout scenarios.

### Behave

**Behave** uses the **BDD (Behavior Driven Development)** method and enables easy writing of natural language based tests with Gherkin syntax. This closes the feedback loop between product managers, QA, and developers.

**Use case:** If on homepage, click on login, then they should see the dashboard.

### Robot Framework

**Robot Framework** is keyword-based and supports desktop as well as web automation. It is used the most by QA engineers and non-technical people due to its readable, table-based syntax and a huge collection of plugins.

**Typical combination:** Typically combined with SeleniumLibrary for GUI automation.
