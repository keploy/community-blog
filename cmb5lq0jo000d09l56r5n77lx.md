Overall, the transition to Agile Testing is a comprehensive process that involves changes in culture, processes, tools, and roles, all aimed at improving collaboration, adaptability, and product quality.

## What Does an Agile Tester Do?

An Agile Tester collaborates with the development team, participates in planning meetings, writes and executes tests, and ensures that the software meets the defined acceptance criteria. They play a crucial role in maintaining quality throughout the development lifecycle.

Testing and QA are everyone’s responsibility in Agile. So testers and developers working in an Agile environment need to work closely together. Communication and collaboration are key.

Agile development is often driven by tests. Developers use Agile testing methods like test-driven development (TDD) to write the test first. Then they write the code that will be verified by the test. And developers and Agile testers should collaborate before user stories (e.g., requirements) are set.

Once development and testing are underway, close communication and collaboration remain important. Agile testers should be testing as developers write code. Plus, developers will probably do some testing. And Agile testers will probably do some coding.

## Agile Development Methodologies for Testers

Agile Testing fits within several development frameworks:

* **Scrum:** Testing is integrated into sprints, with testers collaborating daily with developers.
    
* **Kanban:** Testing workflows are visualized alongside development tasks, helping manage work in progress.
