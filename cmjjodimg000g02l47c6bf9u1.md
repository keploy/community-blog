Modern software development is continuously operating in a high-paced environment with high-pressure expectations to produce quality applications. To meet this expectation, open source automation tools help provide a faster, smoother testing process for today's applications by providing a single tool to test all layers, including web, mobile, API, and performance. Therefore, testing is now accessible to companies regardless of the licensing price tag of the tool; however, selecting the most efficient tool from an overcrowded ecosystem can often be overwhelming. Understanding how these [**open source tools**](https://keploy.io/blog/community/top-10-futuristic-open-source-testing-tools) fit into modern testing practices helps teams navigate this complexity with greater clarity.

## **What are Open Source Automation Tools?**

Open source automation tools are software applications that enable automation of repetitive tasks, including software development, workflow processing, and software testing that occur during the [**software development cycle**](https://keploy.io/blog/community/software-development-phases).  These software applications are freely available for use, modification, distribution, and integration into customised software workflow processes.  

They can be used for many types of automation, including:

* **UI Automation -** Simulate user actions for web/mobile applications.
    
* **API Automation -** Validate API Endpoints, Responses, and Integration Flows.
    
* **Performance Testing -** Measure how an application performs when under a heavy workload.
    
* **Workflow Automation -** Allow users to create workflows that connect multiple applications together.
    

 By taking advantage of these features, organisations can improve the speed at which they develop their applications, increase the quality of the software, and decrease the amount of manual effort required in the development process.

## **Why Select Open Source Automation Testing Tools Instead of Commercial Testing Tools?**

Open-source software testing tools provide numerous advantages to users:

* **Cost savings –** eliminating the need to pay licensing fees provides an opportunity for other investments in initial setup costs.
    
* **Customization –** ability to change the source code for any specific need(s).
    
* **Access to a community –** having an abundance of developers using open-source tools provides opportunities for plugin contribution and the ability to provide assistance to others.
    
* **Visibility –** having access to all aspects of the way a tool is built gives everyone confidence in the reliability and safety of the tool.
    

  
The right balance of open-source tools will enable users to obtain the maximum advantages of automation testing and to minimize the potential hazards associated with the use of open-source tools.

## FAQs

### **1\. Can open source automation tools be used in regulated or enterprise environments?**

Yes, open-source automation tools are being used by several organizations in regulated industries through the use of their internal governance, performing security reviews, creating controlled CI/CD pipelines, and ensuring the use of tools that meet all licensing compliance requirements. Implementing auditing processes and role-based access controls will help ensure that an organization's enterprise compliance and regulatory requirements are met.

### 2\. How do open source automation tools scale as teams and test suites grow?

The scalability of open-source automation testing tools depends upon many factors, including whether or not it has the capability to execute tests in parallel, if it is compatible with CI/CD pipelines, and how the infrastructure for supporting the tests has been set up. When these tools are combined with the use of containerization, cloud runners, and distributed execution, they can be effectively scaled to support the large and complex test suites.

### **3\. What skills are required to successfully adopt open source automation testing tools?**

Teams need to have minimally each team member have a foundational programming knowledge, an understanding of testing concepts, and experience/knowledge of working with CI/CD workflows. Effective collaboration between the Developers and QA Engineers significantly increases the success of effectively implementing and maintaining open-source automation frameworks.

### **4\. How do open source automation tools fit into a shift-left or DevOps testing strategy?**

Open-source automation testing tools effectively support both the shift-left and DevOps methodologies by enabling testing to be performed earlier, performing automated regression testing continuously through CI/CD pipelines, and providing real-time feedback on the results of those automated regression tests to the development and QA teams. As a result, organizations can detect defects earlier and execute their release cycles more quickly and reliably.
