TDD refers to Test Driven Development and BDD refers to Behavior Driven Development; are fairly similar development approaches that both emphasize testing and collaboration, yet have major differences.

TDD is more developer-centric, revolving around code correctness, with programming language-specific frameworks. On the other hand, BDD is more user-centric and revolves more around system behavior. In this article, we will explore in-depth what is TDD and BDD. So, let's dive in!

## What is TDD?

TDD refers to **Test Driven Development**, which involves writing automated tests before writing the code. The results from these automated tests provide insights for the developer to improve their code. TDD is a more focused and disciplined approach to development, and is itself a way to provide continuous feedback for faster bug identification and debugging.

## How to implement TDD in Project?

TDD is a continuous and iterative process of improving your code through tests. The goal after each test is to make the code incrementally better.

1. **Write a Test**: Developers start the TDD process by writing a test for a small piece of functionality that your code should achieve. This test will initially fail because the functionality is not yet implemented. You can use test automation tools like [Keploy](https://keploy.io) to achieve this purpose.
    
2. **Run the Test**: Run the test to ensure it fails. This step confirms that the test is valid and the functionality is indeed missing.
    
3. **Write Code**: Write the minimal amount of code necessary to make the test pass. Focus on getting the test to pass rather than writing perfect code.
    
4. **Run the Test Again**: Run the test again to see if it passes. If it does, you have successfully implemented the functionality as required.
    
5. **Refactor**: Refactor the code to improve its structure, readability, and maintainability without changing its behavior. Ensure that the tests still pass after refactoring.
    
6. **Repeat**: Repeat the cycle, gradually building up the functionality by writing tests first and then writing the code to pass those tests.
    

### Example of TDD

When building a add function that adds two numbers, a TDD approach would involve writing a test case for the “add” function and then writing the code for the process to pass that test.

* **Write the Failing Test:**
    
    ```python
    import unittest
    from calculator import add
    class TestCalculator(unittest.TestCase):
        def test_add(self):
            self.assertEqual(add(2, 3), 5)
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        unittest.main()
    ```
    
* **Run the Test** to ensure it fails, confirming that the `add` function does not yet exist or work correctly.
    
    ```bash
    F
    ======================================================================
    FAIL: test_add (__main__.TestCalculator)
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "test_calculator.py", line 5, in test_add
        self.assertEqual(add(2, 3), 5)
    NameError: name 'add' is not defined
    ```
    
* **Let's create the**`add` Function:
    
    ```python
    def add(a, b):
        return a + b
    ```
    
* **And now re run the Test** to ensure it now passes.
    
    ```bash
    .
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ran 1 test in 0.001s
    
    OK
    ```
    

## What is BDD?

BDD refers to Behavior Driven Development, which is an a[g](https://katalon.com/resources-center/blog/agile-testing-methodology)ile testing methodology that uses system behavior for development. Unlike TDD, BDD starts with analyzing the desired behavior that developers want to create. After that, they’ll express the desired behavior using the **Gherkin syntax**, which consists of ***Given - When - Then*** statements. These statements show developers how to develop the code that fulfills the behaviors described.

## How to perform BDD?

The steps to implement BDD in your software are as follows:

1. **Identify User Stories**: You have to work with stakeholders to identify user stories that describe the desired features.
    
2. **Define Scenarios**: Break down each user story into scenarios and then write each scenario in the **Given-When-Then** format.
    
3. **Automate Tests**: Use a BDD framework to automate the scenarios. Frameworks like Cucumber (for various languages), SpecFlow (for .NET), and Behave (for Python) are commonly used. Also, tools like Keploy can also be used!
    
4. **Write the Code**: Implement the code necessary to pass the automated tests.
    
5. **Run and Refactor**: Run the tests to ensure they pass. Refactor the code as needed to maintain quality and readability.
    

### Example of BDD

Let’s imagine a scenario where a company is developing a new online shopping platform. The business stakeholders want to ensure that the checkout process is seamless and user-friendly. They describe a critical feature: allowing users to apply discount coupons during checkout.

To implement this feature using BDD, the team collaborates to create a set of user stories and scenarios written in Gherkin syntax, which helps both technical and non-technical team members understand the requirements. Here’s how it might look:

```plaintext
Feature: Apply discount coupons during checkout
Scenario: Valid coupon is applied successfully
Given a user has items in their shopping cart And the user has a valid discount coupon When the user applies the discount coupon Then the discount should be applied to the total price And the user should see the updated total price
Scenario: Invalid coupon is rejected
Given a user has items in their shopping cart And the user has an invalid discount coupon When the user tries to apply the discount coupon Then the system should display an error message And the total price should remain unchanged.
```

By following these scenarios, the development team can focus on implementing the necessary code to fulfill these behaviors. The BDD approach ensures that everyone involved has a clear understanding of what the feature should accomplish and how it should behave.

Developers write automated tests based on these scenarios and run them frequently to verify that the application behaves as expected. If a bug is introduced or a feature regresses, these tests will catch the issue early, ensuring that the checkout process remains smooth and reliable for users.

## **What is The Difference Between TDD and BDD?**

Although there are some similarities between TDD and BDD, but there are a quiet a lot of differences too! So, here I'm listing the major differences between both of them:

| **Aspect** | **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** | **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Focus and perspective** | Implementation of code functionality through a test-first approach | Collaboration, shared understanding, and validation of system behavior from a user's perspective |
| **Terminology and readability** | Test cases written with programming-centric terminology | Scenarios written in a natural language format, easily understood by both technical and non-technical team members |
| **Collaboration and communication** | Collaboration between developers and testers | Collaboration among developers, testers, and business stakeholders to define and validate system behavior |
| **Level of abstraction** | Focuses on low-level unit tests that verify the behavior of individual code units | Focuses on higher-level tests that simulate user interactions or end-to-end scenarios |
| **Test organization** | Tests organized based on code structure and hierarchical or modular approach | Scenarios organized around desired behavior, typically grouped by specific features or functionalities |
| **Purpose** | Ensures code correctness through automated tests | Promotes shared understanding, communication, and validation of system behavior |
| **Development workflow** | Tests are written before implementing corresponding code | Scenarios are defined collaboratively before implementing the code. Can implement TDD within BDD |
| **Test scope** | Narrow scope, typically focusing on individual code units | Broad scope, covering multiple units of code working together |
| **Test case style** | Technical and implementation-centric | User-focused and behavior-centric |
| **Test granularity** | Fine-grained, testing individual code units in isolation | Coarser-grained, testing system behavior as a whole |
| **Iterative refinement and feedback** | Iteratively refines code through test failures and subsequent code modifications | Iteratively refines scenarios and behavior through collaboration and feedback |

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### What is TDD?

**Test-Driven Development (TDD)** is a software development methodology where tests are written before the code itself. Developers write a test for a new function or feature, then produce the minimum code necessary to pass the test, and finally refactor the code while keeping the test passing.

### What is BDD?

**Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)** is an extension of TDD that emphasizes collaboration among developers, testers, and business stakeholders. BDD tests are written in natural language and focus on the expected behavior of the application from the user's perspective.

### How do TDD and BDD differ in their approach?

* **TDD** focuses on writing tests before code, with a primary emphasis on the correctness of individual units of code.
    
* **BDD** involves writing behavior specifications before code, emphasizing collaboration and understanding the user's perspective.
    

### Can TDD and BDD be used together?

Yes, TDD and BDD can be complementary. TDD can be used for lower-level unit tests, ensuring the technical correctness of the code, while BDD can be applied to higher-level behavior tests, ensuring the application meets user expectations.

### What tools are commonly used for TDD and BDD?

* **TDD Tools:** Keploy, JUnit, NUnit, TestNG.
    
* **BDD Tools:** Keploy, Cucumber, SpecFlow, JBehave.
    

### Which methodology should I choose for my project?

The choice between TDD and BDD depends on your project needs and team dynamics. If you aim for robust, bug-free code, TDD might be more suitable. If collaboration and meeting user requirements are your priorities, BDD could be the better choice. Combining both can often provide the best results.
