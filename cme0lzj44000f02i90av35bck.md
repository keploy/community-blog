As software systems become distributed, scalable, complex and dynamic, observability tools become essential to ensure smooth functioning of the systems, early detection of the issues and quick resolution. Sentry and Datadog are two main observability tools which is used in the modern [DevOps](https://keploy.io/blog/community/platform-engineering-vs-devops) workflow. Letâ€™s see the detailed comparison of Datadog and Sentry in this blog.

## **What is Sentry?**

![Sentry image](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1752593769168/04be506a-3211-4bf6-9f47-4d15b19927b2.png align="center")

Sentry is an [open-source](https://keploy.io/blog/community/best-opensource-coding-ai) , developer-focused tool built for error tracking and lightweight performance monitoring. It helps developers in track, diagnose, and resolve bugs in real-time by capturing exceptions, crashes, and performance bottlenecks. Originally built for [Python](https://keploy.io/blog/community/python-switch-case-how-to-implement) and [Django](https://keploy.io/docs/quickstart/samples-django/), Sentry has grown since to support many other languages, platforms, and frameworks.

## Key Features of Sentry

1. ### Real-time error tracking
    
    Sentry reports and catches unhandled exceptions and application crashes in real time automatically. It provides more context like stack traces, user data, HTTP request information, and environment metadata like OS or [browser](https://keploy.io/blog/community/cross-browser-testing-a-complete-guide) details. It even has integration with version control systems like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket such that it is capable of showing the actual source code with the error.
    
2. ### Performance Monitoring (APM-Lite)
    
    Sentry is a lightweight application performance monitoring tool which helps to track slow transactions such as API calls, database queries, and frontend rendering issues. It detects performance bottlenecks like N+1 queries in Django or slow component loading in [React.js](https://keploy.io/blog/community/angular-vs-react-complete-guide-for-development-in-2025).
    
3. ### Debugging
    
    Sentry closely integrates with Git to offer rich debugging information. Sentry can attribute an error to a precise commit, pull request, or developer that last changed the problematic line (through git blame). Sentry can even display code diffs and which deployment introduced a bug, which significantly speeds up root cause analysis and enables quicker fixes.
    
4. ### Release and Deployment tracking
    
    With Git integration, Sentry ties errors to individual releases and deployments and enables teams to backtrace bugs to the precise version or change where they were introduced. It uses commit history and, if configured, the CODEOWNERS file to automatically assign errors to the right team or developer.
    
5. ### Open Source & Self-Hostable
    
    Sentry is open-source and provides a self-hosting option, making it best for organizations with high data governance or data privacy requirements. While the majority of teams want to utilize Sentry's cloud-hosted solution due to its simplicity, the on-premise deployment provides full control over the infrastructure, customizations, and data storage especially important to businesses or regulated industries.
    

## What is Datadog?

![Datadog image](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1752593776697/655c8680-f4c5-4988-b7e1-2defbdd4ef5e.png align="center")

Datadog is a cloud-native observability platform focused on monitoring the performance (like monitoring CPU and memory) and health of your applications, infrastructure, and networks (network usage of [EC2](https://keploy.io/blog/community/connecting-a-hosted-ui-website-to-an-aws-ec2-instance) instances and Kubernetes pods). It is capable of error tracking and provides a overall view of your system through metrics, logs, traces, synthetic testing, and more.

## Key Features of Datadog

1. ### Infrastructure Monitoring
    
    Datadog offers a robust, cloud-native platform to gather, analyze, and visualize infrastructure-level data in real-time. Datadog employs a lightweight agent run on servers, virtual machines, or containers. The agent collects System metrics, Network metrics, Process-level metrics, [Container](https://keploy.io/blog/community/podman-vs-docker?_bhlid=f1bd5de9b95a0e0ee6884ba8ac5eade6c469d061) metrics, Cloud metrics.
    
2. ### Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
    
    Datadog Application Performance Monitoring provides deep application behavior visibility, microservice latency breakdown, flame graphs, and distributed traces. It records the journey of a request from frontend to backend entirely with performance bottlenecks and errors in real time.
    
3. ### Log Monitoring
    
    Datadog offers a centralized logging solution that collects logs from wide range of sources like [Kubernetes](https://keploy.io/blog/technology/how-to-test-traffic-with-a-custom-kubernetes-controller) clusters, cloud providers like AWS, Azure, GCP, and other custom softwares. These logs include rich metadata and can be easily searched with an optimized search language to allow quick filtering, pattern matching, and correlation with traces and metrics.
    
4. ### Dashboards and Visualizations
    
    Datadog provides real-time, customizable dashboards to help you visualize logs, metrics, traces, and events in overall system. Interactive views can be created using drag-and-drop widgets like time series charts, heat maps, status tables, top lists, and gauges.
    
5. ### Security Monitoring
    
    Datadog security monitoring utilizes logs and metrics to detect threats, suspicious activity, or cloud-native misconfiguration. It provides integration with security vendors and cloud providers to ingest security events and enforce compliance.

## **How to Automate Tests Without Writing Them**

![Keploy](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1753342485095/3c239153-4670-4541-86ad-891de7df6b0d.png align="left")

In this blog, we explored how platforms such as Datadog and Sentry increase observability. Let's now focus on test automation. There are numerous tools for test automation but the majority of them still need you to code. That's where [Keploy](https://keploy.io/), a no-code testing platform, enters the scene simplifying test automation, making it quicker and more developer-friendly.

Keploy is an open-source tool created with developers in mind, making it easy to automate the creation of realistic test cases and mocks by capturing traffic from your running application. Unlike common testing tools where developers have to manually write test cases, Keploy records API calls and their responses automatically, turning them into test suites that can be replayed during [CI](https://keploy.io/docs/ci-cd/github/) runs.

## **How Keploy Works**

Keploy functions as a test recorder. It records actual [API](https://app.keploy.io/) calls issued to your application, including the request, response, and any external dependencies like database queries. It then automatically generates:

* [**Unit tests**](https://keploy.io/unit-test-generator) â€” Target isolated logic, with mocks imitating database or API responses.
    
* [**Integration Tests**](https://keploy.io/docs/quickstart/openhospital/) â€” These tests use real data and context from live traffic to ensure all components work together.
    
* [**API Tests**](https://keploy.io/api-testing) â€” These tests validates endpoint behavior and ensure schema consistency.
