An **API endpoint** is a defined URL or path where an API accepts a request from the client, such as a web app, mobile app, automation script, or AI agent, and sends back a response.

It serves as the official communication point between the frontend and backend.

In other words, if an API is a restaurant, then the endpoint is the exact table where we take your order.

## Why API Endpoints Matter

API endpoints are significant in that they represent the points of connection between multiple software systems to facilitate communication and data transfer. They enable the way applications, [AI models](https://keploy.io/blog/community/ai-model-testing), and services interact with each other and with people more effectively , automating workflows and improving integration while enhancing overall digital experiences across web, mobile, and cloud settings.

* Every time data is **fetched, created, updated, or deleted**, an endpoint is hit.
    
* **Developers** use endpoints to build features.
    
* **QA testers** validate these endpoints during manual and automated testing.
    
* **Tools like *Keploy* record real API endpoint behavior and automatically convert it into** [**test cases**](https://keploy.io/test-case-generator) **— without writing a single line of test code.**
    
* **AI agents** and **LLMs** utilize endpoints to **execute** real actions or **acquire** live data.
    

## Example of a REST API Endpoint

```xml
GET https://api.example.com/v1/users/123
```

* `GET` → HTTP method
    
* [`https://api.example.com`](https://api.example.com) → API base URL
    
* `/v1/users/123` → **API endpoint (resource path)**
    

This endpoint returns details of **user with ID = 123**.

## API vs Endpoint vs URL vs Route

| Term | Meaning | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **API** | A comprehensive solution providing many endpoints | [`https://api.example.com`](https://api.example.com) |
| **Endpoint** | Exact resource path inside API | `/orders/55/status` |
| **URL** | Full internet address | [`https://api.example.com/orders/55/status`](https://api.example.com/orders/55/status) |
| **Route** | Backend code logic that **executes** the request | Defined in backend framework |

**Every endpoint is a URL — but not every URL is an API endpoint.**

## Types of API Endpoints

### 1\. REST API Endpoints

REST (**Representational State Transfer**) APIs are the most widely adopted pattern on the web. Each endpoint represents a resource (like users, products, orders), and operations are performed using standard **HTTP methods**:

| HTTP Method | Purpose | Example Endpoint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **GET** | Retrieve data | `/users` or `/users/123` |
| **POST** | Create new data | `/users` |
| **PUT** | Update/rewrite existing data | `/users/123` |
| **PATCH** | Partially update data | `/users/123` (only update email) |
| **DELETE** | Remove data | `/users/123` |

### 2\. GraphQL Endpoint

In contrast to REST, GraphQL only utilizes a single endpoint for all actions, regardless of whether you are retrieving, creating, or updating data.

```xml
POST https://api.example.com/graphql
```

Query defines the data — **very flexible**.

### 3\. Webhook Endpoint

In comparison to a traditional API call, a webhook endpoint is different. Rather than having your application call an API, the API will call your endpoint on its own when an event happens.

```xml
https://yourapp.com/webhooks/payment-success
```

### 4\. AI / LLM Endpoints

These **API** endpoints are **utilized** **for** **engaging** with AI models, chatbots, and autonomous agents, **such as** ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, or custom RAG systems.

```xml
POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions
```

## Real API Endpoint Response Example

```xml
GET https://api.example.com/v1/users/123

{
  "id": 123,
  "name": "Himanshu",
  "email": "himanshu@example.com",
  "role": "admin"
}
```

## Why API Endpoints Matter for QA & Testing

* QA teams test and validate all success/failure scenarios on the endpoints.
    
* Postman, Newman, Cypress, and JMeter are widely used.
    
* **Keploy is a modern** [**API testing tool**](https://keploy.io/blog/community/essential-free-api-testing-tools-every-developer-should-know) **that auto-captures real API calls and converts them into test cases and mocks — based directly on API endpoints. This eliminates manual test writing completely.**
    
* Ensures **high test coverage**, especially for regression and CI/CD automation.
    
    ## Best Practices for Designing API Endpoints
    

| Best Practice | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Use **nouns**, not verbs | `/products` ✅ `/fetchProducts` ❌ |
| Always **version your endpoints** | `/v1/orders` |
| Return proper **HTTP status codes** | `200`, `400`, `401`, `500` |
| Secure with **JWT / OAuth / API Keys** | Mandatory for production |
| Use **pagination** for large data | `/users?page=1&limit=50` |

## Security Checklist

* Use **HTTPS only**
    
* Enforce **token-based authentication**
    
* Implement **rate limiting**
    
* Avoid open access CORS
    
* Monitor & log every endpoint hit
    

## Conclusion

An **API endpoint** is the precise address in which an API receives and response to a request. The endpoint is the most important piece of API communication. The understanding of endpoints is important for developers, [**QA automation engineers**](https://keploy.io/blog/community/qa-automation-revolutionizing-software-testing), and builders of AI systems. Modern tools like **Keploy** are changing testing paradigm of auto-generating test cases from real API endpoint behavior -- saving engineering effort on a large scale.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### **Q1. Is every URL an API endpoint?**

No, only URLs made for machine-to-machine communication are suitable candidates for API endpoints. In contrast to an API endpoint, which delivers structured data (e.g. JSON or XML) for software systems, a regular URL is responsible for providing a visitor with a web page (human user). All endpoints are URLs, but not all URLs are automation-friendly endpoints.

### **Q2. How is an endpoint different from a route?**

An endpoint is the publicly accessible address (URL) that an external client can use to communicate with the server. The route exists internally in the backend code of the application, defining how the system will ultimately handle that request. In short, the route is the logic, and the endpoint is the publically exposed address that clients call.

### **Q3. Do GraphQL APIs have multiple endpoints?**

No. GraphQL APIs typically consist of a single endpoint, usually /graphql, used by the AM to handle all queries, mutations, and subscriptions. Rather than calling multiple endpoints like in REST APIs, GraphQL allows clients to specify, in one request, exactly what data they need to receive. This makes GraphQL more efficient, allows clients to batch multiple queries into a single request, reduces network calls, and simplifies the data retrieval process.

### **Q4. Can AI models call API endpoints?**

Yes. Modern AI models and large language models (LLMs) are capable of calling API endpoints in order to retrieve real-time data, perform computations, or trigger actions. For example, the LLM could call APIs to retrieve the weather data, financial data, or use APIs to retrieve analytics data, which will make the AI system more dynamic, context-aware, and allow fully automated tasks to complete without the user.
