It is said that the special nature of software development is ever-changing so it is important to choose the right tool for the job. Whether it's a web interface or a cross-platform mobile app you are building, React and React Native are two of the most powerful technologies available today. This blog will answer the question of "what is React and What is React Native" and show how Keploy can help improve test efficiency across both frameworks. If you are exploring modern frameworks, knowing what React Native and React are will inform your development decision-making.

## What is React?

### Getting Started with React

React is an open-source JavaScript library created by Meta for developing user interfaces, especially for single-page applications. It provides a way to create interactive UIs using a component-based approach. This means we will be developing user interfaces faster and with less complexity than a traditional approach.

### Why React is so Popular with Web Developers

React is popular because of its virtual DOM, page or component-based structure, and unidirectional data flow. These design features allow for better performance and easier debugging. React also has a large developer community and many tools and accompaniments, which make it one of the leading options for front-end developers.

React is leveraged in different applications such as:

* Interactive dashboards
    
* E-commerce websites
    
* Single-page applications (SPAs)
    
* Progressive web applications (PWAs)

## What is React Native?

### Understanding React Native

React Native is specifically a framework that permits developers to create mobile applications using JavaScript and React. Instead of targeting the browser, React Native targets mobile platforms such as iOS and Android. The main differences between React Native and React can be described, as their focus on either mobile platforms (for React Native) or web (for React).

### How React Native Is Used for Mobile App Development

React Native allows for JavaScript and native platform code to communicate together via a bridge. This, combined with React Native's use of components, allows components built in JavaScript to interact with native APIs, and offer nearly native performance but shared code across both platforms.

### React Native Use Cases and Success Stories

React Native is used by companies like Facebook, Instagram, and Walmart. It's ideal for:

* Cross-platform mobile applications
    
* MVPs and prototypes
    
* Mobile apps with shared business logic across platforms
    

## React vs React Native — What’s the Difference?

![React vs React Native](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1750233346583/d41c67a9-bc8e-41bb-9bdf-8e4572743597.png align="center")

### Targeting Platform (Web or Mobile)

React is primarily built for web browsers, whereas React Native is built for mobile software development. This fundamental difference governs how each framework functions.

### Language and Compilation Differences

React renders HTML and CSS with JavaScript. On the other hand, React Native leverages native components and styles written in JavaScript, and compiles to native code for mobile phones.

### Performance and Developer Experience

React is built to help you create web applications quickly with features, such as virtual DOM, reusable components. React Native is not only a rapid development tool - you get benefits like hot-reloading, unified codebase across iOS and android, with performance comparable to native development.

## When to **Choose** React and When to **Choose** React Native?

### **Making** the Right **Choice** for Your Project

If you are building a dynamic web application, choose React. If you need a cross-platform mobile app and want to avoid duplicating your codebase, choose React Native.

### Tips **For** Teams **with** **Development Efforts across** Web and Mobile

* Share **architectural and** business logic between web and mobile
    
* Use unified testing **frameworks** like Keploy
    
* Maintain **functional and** design consistency across platforms

## How Keploy **Works** **with** React **&** React Native Apps

### API Test Automation for Frontend **Engineers**

Keploy records real API calls in your React and React Native app so it can write automated tests for you. This enables you to stop manually writing tests and provides validation that your APIs are correctly functioning.

### **Simplifying** CI/CD for React **&** React Native **Dev** **Teams**

Keploy allows developers to automate tests in CI/CD pipelines so qualitative insights around bugs and defects can be identified early, enabling you to deploy your code with assurance. You can explore further ways to automate your React apps in our guide with [Virtual DOM and Refs](https://keploy.io/blog/community/efficient-dom-manipulation-with-the-virtual-dom-and-refs).

## Final Thoughts on React and React Native

### Summary of Key Differences

| Feature | React | React Native |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Platform | Web | Mobile (iOS, Android) |
| UI | HTML/CSS | Native Components |
| Performance | Virtual DOM | Native APIs via Bridge |
| Use Case | Web Apps | Mobile Apps |

### Selecting the Optimal Framework for Your Stack

React and React Native are both excellent alternatives depending on the user's needs. React is more suitable for dynamic web apps, while React Native is for mobile development leveraging the same code. Testing each platform using Keploy becomes effortless.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### What is the basic difference between React and React Native?

React is for web interfaces and React Native is for mobile apps.

### Can I use React and React Native together?

Yes, you can use React for web and React Native for mobile and share business logic and services.

### Is React Native better than native mobile development?

React Native is for cross-platform apps faster. Native is better for platform-specific features and performance.

### Do React and React Native use the same programming language?

Yes, React and React Native both use JavaScript and JSX, but each renders UI differently.
