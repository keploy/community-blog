Every time a user visits a website, data is transmitted between the web browser and the server through a structured communication protocol. **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)** is the foundation of this exchange, enabling the transfer of web pages, images, and other resources. However, as cybersecurity threats have evolved, the need for a more secure communication channel led to the adoption of **HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)**, which encrypts data to protect user privacy.

This blog explores the **key differences between HTTP and HTTPS**, their impact on **website security, SEO, and performance**, and why migrating to HTTPS is crucial for modern web applications.

## What is HTTP?

**HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)** is an **application-layer protocol** that facilitates communication between **web browsers** and **web servers**. It serves as the foundation of data exchange on the internet, allowing users to access websites and retrieve web pages, images, videos, and other resources.

## How HTTP Works

When a user enters a URL in a browser, an **HTTP request** is sent to the web server hosting the requested content. The server processes this request and responds with the required data, typically in the form of an **HTTP response** containing an HTML document, CSS files, JavaScript, or other media.

The process follows a **client-server architecture**, where:

1. **The client (browser)** initiates a request by sending an **HTTP request** to the server.
    
2. **The server** processes the request and returns the requested data in an **HTTP response**.
    
3. The browser renders the received data to display the web page.

HTTP was designed for fetching HTML pages but along with the time it continuously evolved and with lots of improvement, nowadays it is used for transferring a variety of data like images, videos, audio, and documents. etc

## What are the Key Features of HTTP?

* **Stateless Protocol** – Each request is independent and does not retain information about previous interactions.
    
* **Human-Readable** – Uses plain-text communication, making it easy to understand and debug.
    
* **Supports Multiple Methods** – Includes request methods like **GET, POST, PUT, DELETE**, enabling different types of interactions.
    
* **Based on TCP/IP** – Relies on **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)** for reliable data delivery.
    
* **Flexible** – Supports multimedia content and various data formats like HTML, JSON, and XML.
    

Now let’s discuss the two most important features of HTTP:

1. **HTTP is connectionless:** After making the request, the client disconnects from the server, then when the response is ready the server re-establishs the connection again and delivers the response
    
2. **HTTP is stateless:** The client and server know about each other just during the current request, if it closes, and the two computers want to connect again, they need to provide information to each other, and the connection is handled as the very first one.
    

## How do HTTP Methods Work?

HTTP handles two types of methods request and response!!

1. ### Request
    

![photo_2022-06-06_23-32-45.jpg](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1654618800422/fLnzJ6tUk.jpg align="left")

**Method** tells us about what to do!

**URL refers to,**

* Uniform resource identifier
    
* It is a set of readable characters
    
* and a way to locate the resource
    

**Header-** Specifies some information and the rules for example the server

2. ### Response

It tells the client if the request succeeded or failed. For example, 200 ok, 404 not found

## Limitations of HTTP

* **No Encryption** – Data is transmitted in plain text, making it vulnerable to **man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks**.
    
* **No Data Integrity** – Does not provide a way to verify if data was altered during transmission.
    
* **Lack of Authentication** – HTTP does not inherently verify the identity of the communicating parties.
    

Due to these security concerns, **HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)** was introduced to encrypt communication and ensure secure data transmission.

## Introduction to HTTPS: Securing Web Communication

In today’s digital world, securing online data is more important than ever. That’s where **HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)** comes in. Unlike HTTP, which transmits data in plain text, **HTTPS encrypts data** to protect it from eavesdropping, tampering, and cyber threats.

Whether you're making an **online payment, logging into accounts, or handling sensitive information**, HTTPS ensures that your data remains **private and secure**. But how exactly does this security work? Let’s dive into the mechanics behind HTTPS encryption.

### How HTTPS Protects Your Data

Now let’s understand what is the meaning of S in HTTPS, So very simply S represents secure, which means that the content travelling between the server to the browser is encrypted so that no one can penetrate or steal the data travelling between the server and the browser

This security is much needed while online payment and logging into some websites, Now we will dig a bit deeper into this security protocol or you can say that now we will understand how things work in this encryption.

So firstly this encryption is achieved by SSL/TLS certificate provided by a third-party CA (certification authority) like Godaddy, cloud flare, sectigo .etc to the websites and an SSL certificate stays inside our browser which is used for matching and verifying the approved certificate which our website is carrying.

## Asymmetric vs. Symmetric Encryption in SSL/TLS: What’s the Difference?

Now let’s understand SSL/TLS The complete form of SSL is a secure socket layer and TLS is Transport layer security which is of two types:

1. ### Asymmetric
    
    * Uses **two keys**:
        
        * A **public key** for encryption.
            
        * A **private key** for decryption.
            
    * The browser encrypts data using the server’s **public key**, and only the server’s **private key** can decrypt it.
        
    * Ensures secure key exchange before data transmission.
        
    

![photo_2022-06-06_23-32-54.jpg](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1654624532709/CAst5v4Y4.jpg align="left")

In Asymmetric encryption, encryption happens with the browser’s public key but decryption happens with the server’s private key. This kind of encryption is achieved by two types of keys that’s why it is known as an asymmetric method. ([for understanding, encryption key exchange refer to this video](https://youtu.be/T4Df5_cojAs))

2. ### Symmetric
    
    * Uses **one key** for both encryption and decryption.
        
    * After the **initial handshake (asymmetric encryption)**, a **shared session key** is created for faster encryption.
        
    * Ensures high-speed secure communication.

In symmetric encryption, both encryption & decryption occur with the same key, that’s why this method is known as a symmetric method.

While SSL encryption, both symmetric and asymmetric methods work combine to give more security!!

## Conclusion

In an era where cybersecurity threats are constantly evolving, **HTTPS is essential for protecting online data**. By encrypting communication between the browser and the server, HTTPS ensures **data integrity, confidentiality, and authentication**, safeguarding users from cyber threats like **man-in-the-middle attacks and data breaches**.

For businesses, HTTPS not only builds **user trust** but also improves **SEO rankings** and enhances **website credibility**. Whether you're running a personal blog or an e-commerce platform, **securing your website with HTTPS is no longer optional - it's a necessity**.

After Exploring a lot of things about HTTP and HTTPS, I explored APIs which also fascinated me to deep dive into it and write a blog about it, So stay tuned for it, But if you are aware of APIs you must Try out this no-code API testing tool, It reduces your effort while API testing.

## FAQs

### **What is HTTP and how does it work?**

HTTP (**Hypertext Transfer Protocol**) is a **stateless protocol** that facilitates communication between web browsers and servers. It operates on a request-response model, allowing users to retrieve web pages, images, and other resources. However, HTTP does not encrypt data, making it vulnerable to interception.

### **What is the difference between HTTP and HTTPS?**

HTTP is a protocol used for transferring data over the web, while HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) adds encryption via SSL/TLS to secure the data being transferred between the browser and server.

* **HTTP (Unsecured)** – Data is transmitted in plain text, making it susceptible to cyberattacks.
    
* **HTTPS (Secured)** – Uses **SSL/TLS encryption** to protect data from hackers, ensuring privacy and security.
    

### **How does SSL/TLS encryption protect data?**

SSL/TLS encryption ensures that the data transferred between a web server and a browser is encrypted and secure, preventing unauthorized access. It involves both asymmetric encryption (using a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption) and symmetric encryption (using the same key for both encryption and decryption).

SSL/TLS encryption ensures:  
**Asymmetric encryption** for secure key exchange.  
**Symmetric encryption** for fast, encrypted data transfer.  
**Authentication** to verify website legitimacy and prevent spoofing.

### **Why is HTTPS important for websites?**

HTTPS is crucial for securing sensitive information, such as personal details and payment data, ensuring that the data exchanged between users and websites remains private and protected from interception.

### HTTPS is crucial for:

Protecting user data from cyber threats.  
Building trust with visitors through secure connections.  
Boosting SEO rankings, as Google prioritizes HTTPS-enabled sites.  
Enabling secure transactions for online payments and login credentials.

### **How do SSL certificates work?**

SSL certificates are issued by trusted third-party Certification Authorities (CAs) and are used to verify the authenticity of a website. When a browser connects to a website, it checks the SSL certificate to ensure the connection is secure and encrypted.

SSL certificates are issued by **Certification Authorities (CAs)** like **Cloudflare, Let’s Encrypt, and GoDaddy**. They:

* **Authenticate website ownership** and legitimacy.
    
* **Enable HTTPS encryption** by creating a secure connection.
    
* **Display a padlock icon** in the browser, indicating a secure site.
    

### Can I get an SSL certificate for free?

Yes! **Let’s Encrypt** offers **free SSL certificates** for websites. Many web hosting providers also include **free SSL certificates** in their plans.
