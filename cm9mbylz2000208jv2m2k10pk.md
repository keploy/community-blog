AI has become the talk of the town nowadays, right? There are tons of AI tools available for different tasks, and new advancements are coming up daily like vibe coding. But how do you actually *do* vibe coding? Or how do you try out these models? You could use tools like ChatGPT or Claude, but they come with restrictions, and you often need to pay to access full features.

What if you don’t want your data to become part of their training models? That’s where open source coding models come in. You can try them locally, without the internet, and you don’t have to pay for them.

Let’s see Top 7 Open Source AI Coding Tools and how you can try them out.

## **What Does Open Source AI Coding Tools Mean?**

Open source AI coding tools are AI-powered tools (often based on machine learning or LLMs) that help you write, understand, or debug code - and whose source code and/or models are  
freely available for anyone to use, study, modify, and share.

## **What Do These AI Tools Usually Do?**

They can help with:

* Code completion
    
* Code generation (write code from natural language prompts)
    
* Explaining code
    
* Refactoring or optimizing code
    
* Generating tests or documentation
    
* Code search and navigation
    

## Problems with Proprietary AI Coding Tools

Proprietary AI coding tools like **ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor,** or **GitHub Copilot** come with several limitations:

### 1\. Paid & Limited Access

Most proprietary AI coding tools are not fully free. They offer limited usage, and to unlock full capabilities, you need to purchase a subscription or plan.

### 2\. Data Privacy Concerns

When using these tools, your code may be sent to the cloud, which can pose privacy and security risks, especially for companies working with sensitive data. In some cases, your code might even be used to further train these AI models.

### 3\. Other Limitations

* Limited customization
    
* Vendor lock-in
    
* Licensing risks
    

To avoid these issues, many developers prefer using open source coding AI models.

## Why should try Open Source Coding Tools

Open source coding tools like Deepseek-coder-v2, code llama, qwen2.5-coder offer several benefits:

* **Transparency**: You can access model weights and training data, allowing you to run the models locally or fine-tune them as needed.
    
* **Publicly available source code**: For many open source models, the backend code, UI, and even editor plugins (like for VS Code) are open for inspection and modification.
    
* **Open licensing**: These tools are often released under open source licenses like MIT or Apache 2.0, giving you freedom to use and adapt them without legal restrictions.

## Risks That Come with All AI Coding Assistants

Regardless of being open or closed source, there are two major concerns when using AI coding models:

**1\. Security Issues**

Most LLMs have knowledge cutoff dates. In the fast-paced world of open source, vulnerabilities get fixed quickly but AI models may not be aware and could generate vulnerable code.

**2\. Inaccurate Code and Tests**

Sometimes, these models generate code that **looks correct** but is actually **buggy**, missing edge cases or best practices. Not only for code—if you ask these coding assistants to generate tests, they often can’t write test cases based on your app logic. Plus, you still need to do a lot of **copy-pasting**.

### How Do We Solve Inaccurate Code Test Issues?

Without using ChatGPT or Claude, how can we efficiently generate test cases for your app without doing copy-paste? That’s where **Keploy** comes in. You can install the **Keploy VSCode extension** to create unit tests for your app or you can also get it from the GitHub Marketplace.

### Does Keploy Actually Use LLMs?

Yes, Keploy uses LLMs for generating unit tests. Let’s say you need unit test cases for your code instead of writing them manually, you can use Keploy to generate the tests for you. In the backend, Keploy uses multiple LLMs with multiple iterations to create possible unit test cases for your code.

## Conclusion

Open source AI coding tools are a great alternative to proprietary ones, offering transparency, flexibility, and control. The main advantage of using open source AI models is that you can run them locally. In the previous sections, you saw screenshots of how we ran the Qwen models locally without using the internet so your prompts and data never leave your machine. How cool is that, right?

Also, you don’t need to pay to use these models you can run them anytime and still get great responses. If you're interested, you can even fine-tune the model. Not only can you use Qwen models, but you can also run any of the open source AI models listed above locally with just one command. That’s the superpower of open source AI models compared to proprietary ones.

If needed, you can also use **Keploy** to write test cases for the code generated by these AI models.

## FAQ’s

### 1\. What’s the difference between a general-purpose AI model and a coding-specific AI model?

General-purpose models (like GPT-4) perform a wide range of tasks writing poems, solving math problems, answering questions, etc.  
Coding-specific models are trained exclusively for programming tasks and perform much better for software development.

### 2\. Can I fine-tune these open source AI models on my own codebase?

Yes! You can fine-tune or retrain them using your own data which is not possible with most closed-source tools.

### 3\. Can I run these models locally?

Yes! You can use Ollama to run these models locally

### 4\. Does Keploy change my app logic?

No. Keploy doesn’t touch your app logic. It only generates test cases automatically by analyzing your code.

### 5\. Can Keploy fix bugs in my code?

No. Keploy won’t fix your bugs it just writes test cases that detect bugs and ensure your app’s behavior remains correct.
