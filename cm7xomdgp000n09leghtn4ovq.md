## Introduction

Did you know that you can run tests directly within [**Visual Studio Code**](https://keploy.io/blog/community/best-ai-coding-tools-in-2025-for-developers) **(VS Code)**? Thanks to its built-in support for multiple testing frameworks, testing becomes faster and more efficient. You can [debug tests, analyze results](https://keploy.io/blog/community/good-vs-bad-unit-tests-tips-for-making-the-best-decision), and ensure your code’s reliability-all within the IDE.

Testing is crucial in software development to validate code performance, functionality, and stability. Whether you're performing **unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests**, VS Code provides powerful extensions and tools to streamline the process.

In this guide, we’ll walk you through setting up, configuring, writing, and running tests in VS Code.

## **Prerequisites**

Before starting, ensure you have:

* **VS Code Installed**: Download and install [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).
    
* **Code and Test Files**: Prepare some code and corresponding test files.
    
* **Testing Framework Installed**: Install a framework relevant to your language:
    
    * **JavaScript**: [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
        
    * **Python**: [pytest](https://pytest.org/)
        
    * **Java**: [JUnit](https://junit.org/)
        

## **Steps to Run Tests in VS Code**

### **Step 1: Set Up the Testing Environment**

1. **Install Testing Dependencies**
    
    * Run the relevant installation command in your terminal:
        
        ```sh
        npm install --save-dev jest   # For JavaScript
        pip install pytest            # For Python
        mvn test                      # For Java with Maven
        ```
        
2. **Organize Test Files**
    
    * Create a folder called `tests` (or similar) in your project’s root directory.
        
    * Follow naming conventions (e.g., `test_example.py` for Python, `math.test.js` for JavaScript).
        
    * ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1741257341084/d7f076db-ec86-4bc0-a4ce-172462f27d4b.png align="center")
        

### **Step 2: Configure VS Code for Testing**

1. **Modify** `settings.json` (Optional)
    
    * Configure VS Code to recognize your testing framework.
        
    * Open `settings.json` (press `Ctrl + ,` or `Cmd + ,` on Mac) and add:
        
        ```json
        {
          "python.testing.pytestEnabled": true,
          "python.testing.unittestEnabled": false,
          "python.testing.pytestArgs": ["tests"]
        }
        ```
        
2. **Enable Testing Extensions**
    
    * Install and activate the relevant testing extension:
        
        * **Python Testing**: Install the **Python extension**.
            
        * **JavaScript Testing**: Install the **Jest extension**.
            

### **Step 3: Write and Run Tests**

1. **Write a Simple Test**
    
    * **JavaScript (Jest)**
        
        ```js
        test('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {
          expect(1 + 2).toBe(3);
        });
        ```
        
    * **Python (pytest)**
        
        ```python
        def test_addition():
            assert 1 + 2 == 3
        ```
        
    * [**Java (JUnit)**](https://keploy.io/blog/community/how-to-use-junit-on-vs-code-a-comprehensive-guide)
        
        ```java
        import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
        import org.junit.Test;
        public class MathTest {
            @Test
            public void testAddition() {
                assertEquals(3, 1 + 2);
            }
        }
        ```
        
2. **Run the Test**
    
    * Open the test file in VS Code.
        
    * **Use the Testing Panel**:
        
        * Click the **Testing Icon** in the Activity Bar.
            
        * Click **Run All Tests** or click the **play icon** next to a specific test.
            
    * **Run from Terminal (Optional)**:
        
        ```sh
        npm test    # Jest
        pytest      # Python
        mvn test    # JUnit (Maven)
        ```
        

### **Step 4: Debug Your Tests**

1. **Add Breakpoints**
    
    * Click to the left of a line number in your test file to set a **breakpoint**.
        
2. **Start Debugging**
    
    * Right-click the test and select **Debug Test**.
        
    * Use the **Debug Panel** to step through the code, inspect variables, and evaluate expressions
