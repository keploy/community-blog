Modern technology (APIs, Microservices, Cloud Platforms, Mobile Apps) is rapidly changing and becoming a target for attackers as they continue to advance and become more sophisticated. Organizations use penetration testing (a form of ethical hacking) to identify weaknesses in their systems and address them before they can be taken advantage of.

Keploy supports organizations' application security through automated test generation, mocking and regression testing throughout the application development lifecycle. Combined with Penetration Testing after the application has been created, organizations will have increased assurance and resilience against cyberattacks on their applications, APIs, and Cloud Environments in the real world.

## **Why Penetration Testing Is Essential for Modern Systems**

For companies that are built on engineering principles, or for businesses that provide software as a service (SaaS), financial services (FinTech), e-commerce, or are undergoing digital transformation, penetration testing will be an important part of the overall security program. Unlike traditional [Quality Assurance testing](https://keploy.io/blog/community/quality-assurance-testing) and automated test methods, penetration testing provides much deeper insight into application security, and it also identifies the weaknesses in your systems that hackers/public would likely exploit.

### **1\. Identifies Security Gaps Before Attackers Do**

Penetration testing can help find misconfigurations, logical errors, insecure code paths, and insecure integrations that may go undetected by automated scanning tools. If you identify these weaknesses early, you may be able to prevent costly incidents.

### **2\. Strengthens Your Security Posture**

Penetration tests provide insight into where your organization's current weaknesses exist within the infrastructure.

### **3\. Meets Compliance Requirements**

In most industries, including banking and finance (BFSI), education, healthcare and the government, you must conduct regular penetration testing based on your respective industry's regulations. Examples of the types of regulations that would require you to conduct regular penetration testing include:  
• ISO 27001  
• SOC 2  
• GDPR  
• PCI DSS  
• HIPAA

A detailed pen test report supports audit readiness.

### **4\. Prevents Financial and Reputational Damage**

When your organization is impacted by a security breach, it can result in loss of revenue, loss of customers, law suits and damage to trust within your brand. By utilizing penetration testing, you will reduce the risk of being impacted by a security breach significantly.

### **5\. Validates the Security of yours APIs and Microservices**

Newer applications are heavily dependent on APIs, therefore, penetration testing can assist your organization in ensuring that your APIs are not being accessed by anyone without permission; that they cannot be exploited by injection attacks, and that data cannot be extracted from them.

## **How Keploy Complements Penetration Testing**

By processing real-world traffic, Keploy enables consistent quality in application development through automated test case generation, mock generation, and regression suites. This automation results in fewer functional bugs, fewer API53 failures, and lower risk during deployment than when an application was manually tested.

Once an application has passed all quality checks, it will need to go through security testing.

### **Keploy + Penetration Testing = Secure, Reliable Engineering**

Keploy provides developers with [automated testing tools](https://keploy.io/blog/community/ai-testing-tools) to help identify logical and functional errors in their applications, while Penetration Testing validates the security of the application through testing the following:  
• Secure authentication method  
• Strong authorization method  
• No data leakage  
• No exploitable code paths  
• No deployment misconfigurations

Together, this combination of quality and security will improve both quality and security, while not inhibiting the velocity of development.

## **Penetration Testing Service Offerings**

### **1\. Network Penetration Testing (Internal & External)**

Testing your internal and external networks for exposed services, weak configurations, insecure devices and privilege escalation paths, helps you find:  
• Open ports  
• Misconfigured firewalls  
• Poorly segmented networks  
• Old Operating Systems  
• Lateral Movement Opportunities

A secure network is the foundation of your infrastructure.

### **2\. Web Application Penetration Testing**

Web applications are under constant attack (e.g., injection attacks, authentication bypass, cross-site scripting, business logic abuse). We test for: -

* SQL/NoSQL Injection
    
* Authentication Flaws
    
* Session Hijacking
    
* Broken Access Control
    
* Misconfigured Security Headers
    
* File Upload Vulnerabilities
    
* API Communication Flaws
    

We align our testing with OWASP's Top 10 and modern threat vectors.

### **3\. API Penetration Testing**

APIs are the core of SaaS and **Cloud**\-**Native** **Platforms**. **APIs** require **a** deeper analysis **than** **merely** functional testing. We **include testing for**: **\-**

* Broken **Object**\-**Level** **Authorization** (BOLA)
    
* Insecure API **Keys/Tokens**
    
* Rate **Limit** **Issues**
    
* Endpoint **Enumeration**
    
* Injection **Vulnerabilities**
    
* Data **Exposure** **Risks**
    

Keploy provides API reliability, but penetration testing provides API security.

### **4\. Mobile Application Penetration Testing**

Mobile Apps are storing personal data, Tokens and other Sensitive Information. Weak Mobile Security leads to high-impact breaches. We test for: -

* Local Data Storage Risks
    
* Weak Encryption
    
* Hard-coded Keys
    
* API Communication Flaws
    
* Reverse Engineering Threats
    
* Root/Jailbreak Bypass Protection
    

Both Android and iOS devices can have vulnerabilities.

### **5\. Cloud Security Testing**

Type of security testing: it checks for misconfigurations within your public or private cloud infrastructures which are a top contributor to breaches today. We conduct testing on all cloud environment types including AWS, Azure, GCP, DigitalOcean, and hybrid cloud environments.

Testing areas include:

• IAM privileges misconfigured

• Services exposed publicly (Internet-accessible)

• Storage bucket data leaks

• All inbound rules permitted

• Misconfigured serverless services

We ensure your cloud deployments follow best security practices.

### **6\. Wireless Network Penetration Testing**

Weak Wi-Fi networks are one of the leading reasons organizations are compromised via unauthorized access.

What we have tested includes:

• Wi-Fi encryption strength

• Rogue Wi-Fi access point detection

• Credentials brute-force attacks

• Spoofing MAC addresses

### **7\. Social Engineering Testing (Optional)**

The use of social engineering as a basis for exploiting individuals, rather than relying upon exploited technologies, may constitute a serious threat to individual privacy rights and the integrity of their business data. Additionally, social engineering is used to create legitimate avenues for attackers to access and manipulate sensitive and/or personal information stored within your organization.

Examples of how we simulate such techniques include:

• Phishing emails

• Pretextual telephone calls

• Impersonation of an employee/supervisor/other person for the purposes of acquiring access or sensitive information from an organization.

This service allows for measuring both the culture of security awareness and employee training regarding social engineering tactics.
