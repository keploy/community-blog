Test Driven Development (TDD) is a development practice where you write tests before writing the code. While it’s traditionally used for unit testing, TDD shines brightest when applied to **End-to-End (E2E) API testing**. For developers working in PHP, adopting [TDD for API testing](https://keploy.io/blog/community/understanding-tdd-and-bdd-a-guide-for-developers) can enhance code reliability, speed up debugging, and give you more confidence in the behavior of your APIs.

In this blog, we’ll discuss how **TDD** can be implemented for **E2E API testing in PHP** and explore how **Keploy** can take your testing experience to the next level.

## What is Test Driven Development ?

When you think about API testing, you might think of testing individual endpoints, making sure the requests and responses behave as expected. In **End-to-End (E2E) API testing**, you’re ensuring that the whole flow - from one API call to another - works perfectly in sync. Here’s where **Test Driven Development** (TDD) comes into play.

TDD involves writing tests that simulate real-world interactions with your APIs **before** the backend logic is implemented. These tests focus on checking whether the entire system (APIs, services, databases) works together as expected. By following the TDD loop of “**test, fail, write, refactor**,” you get to test the API’s expected behavior **before** it even exists.

## Why TDD is important?

1. **Catches Issues Early**: TDD enables you to detect API misbehavior or logic flaws even [before the backend](https://keploy.io/blog/community/4-ways-to-accelerate-your-software-testing-life-cycle) implementation is complete.
    
2. **Better Collaboration**: Writing tests upfront ensures that all team members - from frontend to backend developers - are on the same page regarding API functionality.
    
3. **Documentation**: The tests serve as living documentation of how the APIs should behave. This is crucial for onboarding new developers or revisiting code after a while.
    
4. **Faster Debugging and Refactoring**: With tests already in place, when a bug occurs, you can easily pinpoint the issue, fix it, and know that everything works once the test passes.
    

## Getting Started with API Testing using PHPUnit

PHPUnit is one of the most popular testing frameworks used for unit testing in PHP, but it’s also great for **E2E API testing**. Here’s how you can use PHPUnit for testing APIs in a TDD manner.

### 1\. **Install PHPUnit**

Start by installing PHPUnit via Composer if you haven’t done so already:

```bash
composer require phpunit/phpunit
composer require guzzlehttp/guzzle
```

Create a phpunit.xml configuration:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<phpunit bootstrap="vendor/autoload.php"
         colors="true"
         verbose="true">
    <testsuites>
        <testsuite name="User API Test Suite">
            <directory>tests</directory>
        </testsuite>
    </testsuites>
</phpunit>
```

### 2\. **Write Your First API Test**

Let’s say you're working on an API that returns user details. The first step in TDD would be to write a test for the **GET** request to `/api/users/{id}`.

```php
<?php

use PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase;
use GuzzleHttp\Client;
use GuzzleHttp\Exception\ClientException;

class UserApiTest extends TestCase
{
    private Client $client;
    private string $baseUrl = 'http://localhost:8000/api.php';
    private array $testUser;
    private $createdUserId;

    protected function setUp(): void
    {
        $this->client = new Client([
            'base_uri' => $this->baseUrl,
            'http_errors' => false
        ]);

        // Create a test user for use in tests
        $this->testUser = [
            'name' => 'Test User',
            'email' => 'test@example.com'
        ];

        // Create the test user and store the ID
        $response = $this->client->post('', [
            'json' => $this->testUser
        ]);
        $data = json_decode($response->getBody()->getContents(), true);
        $this->createdUserId = $data['id'];
    }

    protected function tearDown(): void
    {
        // Clean up - delete the test user if it exists
        if (isset($this->createdUserId)) {
            $this->client->delete("?id={$this->createdUserId}");
        }
    }

    public function testGetAllUsers()
    {
        $response = $this->client->get('');

        $this->assertEquals(200, $response->getStatusCode());
        $data = json_decode($response->getBody()->getContents(), true);
        $this->assertIsArray($data);
        
        // Verify the structure of a user object
        $firstUser = $data[0] ?? null;
        if ($firstUser) {
            $this->assertArrayHasKey('id', $firstUser);
            $this->assertArrayHasKey('name', $firstUser);
            $this->assertArrayHasKey('email', $firstUser);
            $this->assertArrayHasKey('created_at', $firstUser);
        }
    }

    public function testGetSpecificUser()
    {
        $response = $this->client->get("?id={$this->createdUserId}");

        $this->assertEquals(200, $response->getStatusCode());
        $data = json_decode($response->getBody()->getContents(), true);
        
        $this->assertArrayHasKey('id', $data);
        $this->assertArrayHasKey('name', $data);
        $this->assertArrayHasKey('email', $data);
        $this->assertArrayHasKey('created_at', $data);
        
        $this->assertEquals($this->createdUserId, $data['id']);
        $this->assertEquals($this->testUser['name'], $data['name']);
        $this->assertEquals($this->testUser['email'], $data['email']);
    }

    public function testGetNonExistentUser()
    {
        $response = $this->client->get('?id=99999');
        
        $this->assertEquals(404, $response->getStatusCode());
        $data = json_decode($response->getBody()->getContents(), true);
        $this->assertArrayHasKey('error', $data);
    }

    public function testCreateUser()
    {
        $newUser = [
            'name' => 'New Test User',
            'email' => 'newtest@example.com'
        ];

        $response = $this->client->post('', [
            'json' => $newUser
        ]);

        $this->assertEquals(201, $response->getStatusCode());
        $data = json_decode($response->getBody()->getContents(), true);
        
        $this->assertArrayHasKey('id', $data);
        $this->assertArrayHasKey('message', $data);
        
        // Clean up - delete the newly created user
        $this->client->delete("?id={$data['id']}");
    }

    public function testCreateUserWithInvalidData()
    {
        $invalidUser = [
            'name' => 'Invalid User'
            // missing email
        ];

        $response = $this->client->post('', [
            'json' => $invalidUser
        ]);

        $this->assertEquals(400, $response->getStatusCode());
        $data = json_decode($response->getBody()->getContents(), true);
        $this->assertArrayHasKey('error', $data);
    }

    public function testUpdateUser()
    {
        $updatedData = [
            'name' => 'Updated Test User'
        ];

        $response = $this->client->put("?id={$this->createdUserId}", [
            'json' => $updatedData
        ]);

        $this->assertEquals(200, $response->getStatusCode());
        
        // Verify the update
        $response = $this->client->get("?id={$this->createdUserId}");
        $data = json_decode($response->getBody()->getContents(), true);
        $this->assertEquals($updatedData['name'], $data['name']);
    }

    public function testUpdateNonExistentUser()
    {
        $response = $this->client->put('?id=99999', [
            'json' => ['name' => 'Test']
        ]);

        $this->assertEquals(404, $response->getStatusCode());
        $data = json_decode($response->getBody()->getContents(), true);
        $this->assertArrayHasKey('error', $data);
    }

    public function testDeleteUser()
    {
        // Create a user specifically for deletion
        $response = $this->client->post('', [
            'json' => [
                'name' => 'To Be Deleted',
                'email' => 'delete@example.com'
            ]
        ]);
        $data = json_decode($response->getBody()->getContents(), true);
        $userIdToDelete = $data['id'];

        // Delete the user
        $response = $this->client->delete("?id={$userIdToDelete}");
        $this->assertEquals(200, $response->getStatusCode());

        // Verify the user is deleted
        $response = $this->client->get("?id={$userIdToDelete}");
        $this->assertEquals(404, $response->getStatusCode());
    }

    public function testDeleteNonExistentUser()
    {
        $response = $this->client->delete('?id=99999');
        
        $this->assertEquals(404, $response->getStatusCode());
        $data = json_decode($response->getBody()->getContents(), true);
        $this->assertArrayHasKey('error', $data);
    }
}
```

### 3\. **Run the Test**

Now, run PHPUnit to see the test fail (as the actual code for the `/api/users/{id}` endpoint probably doesn’t exist yet):

```bash
./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/UserApiTest.php
```

## The Power of Keploy in E2E API Testing

[Keploy.io](http://keploy.io) is a **modern AI based testing platform** that provides **API testing** and [**Test Data Management**](https://keploy.io/blog/community/diverse-test-data-boosting-regression-testing-efficiency#challenges-of-managing-diverse-test-data). By seamlessly integrating with your PHP application, Keploy can record, replay, and validate API interactions, allowing you to **focus on writing tests rather than manually managing test data**. Whether you’re working on new APIs or refactoring old ones, Keploy enhances your TDD process by reducing the manual effort and speeding up the testing lifecycle.

## How Keploy Simplifies TDD for E2E API Testing

1. **Record and Replay API Interactions**: Keploy allows you to record actual API calls and responses, which can later be used for **replaying tests**. This is perfect for **end-to-end testing**, where the whole interaction cycle between your API endpoints needs to be tested.
    
2. **Mock API Responses**: With Keploy, you can easily [mock API responses for scenarios](https://keploy.io/docs/keploy-explained/introduction/#%EF%B8%8F-multi-purpose-mocks) where the backend logic might not yet be implemented, but you still need to test the integration of the API with other services or components.
    
3. **Version Control for Test Data**: One of the challenges of API testing is managing test data. Keploy takes care of that by storing API responses as snapshots, making it easy to track changes in the behavior of your APIs as they evolve. This is a huge help when following the TDD cycle, where you may need to revisit and adjust tests regularly.
    
4. **Seamless Integration with PHPUnit**: Keploy integrates smoothly with PHPUnit, the go-to framework for PHP developers. You can easily configure Keploy to run alongside PHPUnit tests, making it an ideal companion for TDD-driven E2E API testing.
    

## Setting Up Keploy in Your PHP Project

1. **Install Keploy**:
    
    To get started with Keploy, you’ll first need to install the Keploy :
    
    ```bash
    curl -O -l https://keploy.io/install.sh && source install.sh
    ```
    
2. **Record API Interactions.**
    
    Simply make a real API call, and Keploy will record the request and response:
    
    ```bash
    keploy record -c "<application command>"
    ```
    
    And Later, you can replay this interaction to test the functionality of your APIs:
    
    ```bash
    keploy test -c "<application command>" --delay 15
    ```
    
3. **Automate Test Data Management.**
    
    Keploy automatically create data mocks based on API interaction to ensure consistency in your tests, even across multiple environments.
    

## Best Practices for E2E API Testing in PHP with TDD

* **Keep Tests Focused and Independent**: Each test should be self-contained and focused on one behavior at a time.
    
* **Mock External Services**: If your API relies on external services, mock them during testing to ensure your tests remain fast and reliable.
    
* **Automate API Response Validation**: Use tools like Keploy to validate API responses automatically, reducing manual effort and errors.
    
* **Use Continuous Integration (CI)**: Integrate your TDD and E2E API tests with CI tools (like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI) to ensure your tests run automatically during every deployment.
