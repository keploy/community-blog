These days, in the quickly evolving world of software, just executing automated testing is not sufficient. Real quality only results from what follows results analysis, pattern tracking, and insights from failure.**Test reporting and analytics** come into their own here.

By converting raw test data into valuable insights, teams can catch [flaky tests](https://keploy.io/blog/community/what-is-a-flaky-test), pinpoint common problems, and make better decisions more quickly. It's not about knowing whether or not a test passed - it's about knowing why it failed and how to do better next time. Test reporting, in short, makes testing a strategic strength.

![Test Reporting Flowchart](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1753177528684/2c3e8a15-1128-4144-b8d3-dc0609473ada.png align="center")

## What Is Test Reporting?

Test reporting is the process of collecting, counting, and presenting the results of software testing in a meaningful and understandable way. Whether writing unit tests, integration tests, API tests, or UI tests, the end goal is always the same: to provide an easily understandable representation of the results so that teams can make informed decisions about the health and stability of their software.

In practice, a good test report is not a show of pass/fail percentages. It's more helpful in giving answers that are vital in nature, such as:

* Which tests failed and why?
    
* How long was the test runs?
    
* Are there any that recur over builds?
    
* Is the test suite getting better each day or worse in some manner?
    

A good test report will at least contain:

* Number of tests run, with result type pass, fail, skip, or error
    
* Runtimes to determine the performance bottlenecks or slow tests
    
* Metadata like environment, OS, browser version, and build number
    
* Complete failure logs, stack traces, screenshots (for UI tests), and error codes for debugging
    

Rather than slogging through stark console output or CI logs, test reports visually display possibility and render information actionable - converting signal into sense. This enables developers to debug more rapidly, QA engineers to detect patterns, and project managers to determine end-to-end release readiness.

Short of it, test reporting closes the loop between test run and quality insight, providing your team with context to quality software with potential.

## Best Test Reporting Tools

With increased focus on quality and timely delivery, enterprises have never needed better and timely **test reporting tools** ever. The present marketplace is filled with all types of options - each for different types of teams, workflows, and testing methodologies.

Some of the best tools available in the market are as follows:

1. **Allure TestOps**: Allure TestOps is a lightweight reporting solution with pretty UX to read, natively handling various languages and test frameworks. Allure excels when it is able to **distinguish failures on test logic vs test bugs** so teams are able to quickly see flakiness regressions. Stunning visualizations and fantastic CI/CD integration make it a top pick among teams who need stunning reporting and actionable feedback.
    
2. **ReportPortal**: If you need an open-source one with good analytics, ReportPortal is the place. It has **real-time dashboards**, **AI/ML-based failure clustering**, and **automatically identifies root causes**. Its team features (like correlating failures against issue trackers) are great for big QA teams. ReportPortal builds a history context of your test suite over time so that you can see stability trends and reproduce pain spots.
    
3. **ExtentReports + Klov**: They who require **adorbs HTML reports** will be amply rewarded with ExtentReports. It provides and so does Klov include history, charts, and live reporting with MongoDB support. They bring form and function together - executive - level run-of-reports or stakeholder demoing material.
    
4. **TestNG / JUnit + Jenkins or GitLab CI**: Nearly all use the reliable old - **JUnit** and **TestNG** - and vintage CI tools like **GitLab CI** or **Jenkins**. They produce **JUnit XML reports**, which your CI pipeline can convert to dashboards. Not as flashy, perhaps, as some of the newer report tools, but thoroughly tested, easy to install, and flexible with scripts and plugins.
    
5. **Tesults**: Tesults is an API and integration-level test team-sized production platform. It supports **real-time dashboards embedded**, **trend visualization**, and **CI/CD integrations** natively. Its best feature is its API upload of the test data, making it simple to upload metadata like test owner, priority, and related feature. It is best for remote or distributed teams that need central visibility into their test results.
    
6. **Cucumber Reports**: Cucumber Reports transform Gherkin syntax output to human-readable summary.
    
7. **TestRail**: **TestRail** ideal for high test case numbers with traceability to requirement, test run, and release.
    
8. **XRay**: XRay, very extensively used as a Jira plugin, is highly integrated into agile processes - offering end-to-end visibility from requirement through execution through defect.
    

Each tool brings unique strengths - some focus on real-time analytics, while others excel in visual storytelling or integration flexibility.

## Keploy: Autogenerated Test Cases & Reporting out of Live API Workloads

Worst part of testing software is probably test case creation and maintenance - particularly for large, complicated APIs. [Keploy](https://keploy.io/) turns all that on its head with autogenerated test cases and mocks from actual user traffic, so it's a great addition to any test report software.

Keploy lives in your dev or staging environment, catches real API calls, and constructs working test cases and mock dependencies. Why's it good? Production-grade tests in the wild that replay on CI runs with minimal human labor.

![Keploy](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1754474699602/3730c6a3-6349-43fa-9bc6-9d732fde5a6b.png align="center")

But neither does Keploy stop there, either - nor does it deviate from **pretty test reports**. When running tests locally or in CI, Keploy generates pretty, rich JUnit-compatible reports, easily rendered customizable to integrate with the most popular CI tools like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins.

How Keploy for teams today differs:

* **No more tedium of boilerplate-heavy test script writing:** Keploy auto-generates from actual API traffic - no more drudgery of boilerplate-heavy.
    
* **Production-high-confidence quality:** Since test cases are generated automatically from actual user requests, they match high-fidelity workflows, and thus improved bug detection.
    
* **CI-friendliness of test results:** JUnit XML outputs allow easy integration of Keploy reports to your CI/CD dashboards and analytics streams.
    
* **Isolation mock generation:** Keploy not only tests APIs but also auto-generates mocks of dependent services, giving you that added level of failure isolation.
    

Use Keploy to close the loop between real behavior and test cases you simulate - particularly when greater accuracy and traceable insight into backend API health is a requirement. Wherever you require faster feedback cycles or maintaining your test suite in line with minimal overhead being an issue, Keploy makes wise testing smart and far more scalable.

## Types & Components of Test Reports

Not all test reports are equal - and praise the universe for it. The top test reporting frameworks are built with their users in mind, giving every stakeholder just the information they need without drowning them in data they do not care about.

![Types of test report](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1753177636089/efe2f387-88e8-440f-8423-14674fdeb175.png align="center")

Let's talk about the three most popular types of test reports engineering teams employ:

**1\. Developer Reports**

These are test reports designed to work. They dig into the technical depth of every test case such that developers can easily see why failures occur. An effective developer report has:

* Test identifiers and suite context
    
* Logs recorded during test runs
    
* Environment variables and config information
    
* Stack traces and error messages
    
* Screenshots or video (particularly helpful for UI or end-to-end tests)
    

With this degree of richness, developers can replicate problems locally or in a debug environment, reducing time to bug fix.

**2\. QA Reports**

QA engineers should receive some context. Their reports commonly report test coverage, failure rate, and suite health overall. They may categorize failures by:

* Severity (e.g., critical, major, minor)
    
* Frequency (e.g., intermittent vs. consistent failures)
    
* Test suite or module (e.g., API tests, regression suite, UI tests)
    
* Flaky tests that need stabilization or rework
    

Prioritizing repetition issues, test instability, or test debt enables QA teams to decide what must be addressed prior to the next release.

**3\. Managerial Summaries**

Product owners, project managers, and executives don't care about logs - they care about simplicity. Managerial reports are metrics and trends informing release decisions:

* Pass/fail ratios by build
    
* Build readiness and release confidence levels
    
* Trends in test stability over time
    
* Regression rates for sprint cycles
    

These high-level summaries enable teams to make a decision regarding whether or not the software is ready for production and whether the test strategy is paying dividends in the long term.

**4\. Shared Elements For All Reports**

* Good test reports, notwithstanding the variant audience, include a number of common elements:
    
* Test Name or ID: A unique identifier for the particular test case
    
* Test Suite or Module: Where the test lives in the codebase or system
    
* Execution Status: Pass, fail, or skip
    
* Execution Time: Useful to find performance hotspots
    
* Failure Details: Logs, stack traces, and error codes of the failures
    
* Artifacts: Screenshots, video recordings, or console prints for added context
    
* Environment Metadata: OS, browser version, device, build ID, etc.
    
* Tags & Classifications: Tags such as **critical**, **flaky**, or **security** for quick filtering
    
* Historical Context: Last run status, history of flakiness, and changes to the build
    

These features render reports not just beneficial, but actionable - enabling teams to monitor quality over time, spot trends, and enhance test credibility

## **How It Works: Code to Dashboard**

Novel trial report systems collect natural statistics from the run and transform them into useful information that will be used to make technological decisions.

![Code to Dashboard](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1753177705799/5805775d-5ab9-4508-bba3-7f3a778bed7e.png align="center")

**1\. Structured Test Execution Output** of a successful trial end product in structured format, such as JUnit XML, JSON, or TestNG XML. They include features such as trial labels, runtime, standing (pass/fail), slip-up log, and even a snapshot of an ocular expression.

**2\. Continuous Consumption** The artifacts are consumed continuously using the CI/CD plug-ins enjoy (e.g. API Uploads: Jenkins, GitHub, CircleCI. A couple of tools, e.g. , BrowserStack, Allure TestOps ) obtain that spin action more by allowing you to add metadata such as.

* Test priority (P0, P1…)
    
* Owner or responsible team member
    
* Linked test suite/module
    
* Environment metadata (OS, browser, device)
    

**3\. Parse and Visualization** The details will be parsed into an affluent splashboard exposing the vitality of graphic presentation. You usually get it.

* Pass/fail/skipped ratios bar charts and pies
    
* Heatmaps of flaky tests
    
* Trend lines showing test stability over time
    
* Drill-down logs with stack traces and screenshots for root cause analysis
    

**4\. Automated Insights & Trends:** Sophisticated tools have built-in analytics that:

* Track test pass percentages over branches or environments
    
* Plot flaky test behavior over time
    
* Detect new failure additions to past failures
    
* Detect regression trends or too long test runs
    

**5\. Real-time Notifications:** Teams configure notifications through email, Slack, Microsoft Teams, or webhooks to notify:

* Aborted or failed builds
    
* Extremely diverse flaky trial limit misdemeanor Performance stopped development P0 trial circumstance setback escalation Everything in the current grapevine - trial run to presentation toward party - enables quick feedback cringle refinement of software excellence, hurried debugging, and a continuous stream of uninterrupted dispatch potential.
    

## **Re-run Failed Tests & Smarter Monitoring**

The new trial and CI/CD grapevine management tools have a disproportionate amount of intelligent capacity to manage superior and explicit negative feedback.

![Re-run Failed Tests & Smarter Monitoring](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1754475277979/2435a6ca-63bb-4e7a-b36d-bcb363e5c1e7.png align="center")

1. **Selective Test Re-runs:**
    

Alternately, perform the entire suite once more, channels, for instance. , Matrix, **Testmo**, or **CircleCI** provide only a rerun of a failed trial. It would be of particular benefit to.

* **Flaky tests** (rarely failing tests)
    
* Enhancing CI cycle time
    
* Verifying fixes without inundating infrastructure
    

2. **Flaky Test Management:**
    

* Automatically mark flaky tests based on **past failure patterns** and rerun history.
    
* Pin flaky tests as **exclude-from-build-blocks status** inside dashboards or CI pipelines.
    
* Send flaky test issues to corresponding owners or teams to debug.
    

3. **Dynamic Test Prioritization:**
    

* Use trial consequence study to **identify the "hot way”** - mission-critical code flow that must be tested alongside complete testing times, e.g. Login, check, and sync the data ).
    
* Prioritize tests based on recent code changes, developer ownership, or failure rates.
    
* Optimize supply utilization with increased CI load schedule low priority trial examples at the end to achieve better supply utilization with large CI tons.
    

4. **Smart Monitoring and Reporting:**
    

* Automatically report bugs in **issue trackers** (e.g., Jira) on high-priority test failures.
    
* Employ **AI-driven anomaly detection** to detect unusual behavior (e.g., sudden spike in UI test failures).
    
* Correlate **logs and telemetry** with test runs to gain better insights into system health.
    

The parties were able to reduce noise, low CI craziness, and emphasize their debugging efforts where they primarily focused on the actual arrested development and **high priority bug** by introducing witty re-run tactics, contextual notification, and witty trial studies.

## Failure Analysis: Revealing the Root Cause of Test Failures

![Failure Analysis](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1754475834359/5eb090da-b14d-4973-b3de-318d0c1cea38.png align="center")

* It is easy to fix the symptom after a test has failed and simply carry on. But good testing involves taking a closer look to find out about the **root cause**.
    
* Faults are caused by anything from a thousand possible things - perhaps it is an actual **code bug**, a buggy or **flaky test**, a test data **timing issue**, or even some temporary **infrastructure problem**. It's not sufficient to know that something failed - you must know why.
    
* That is where tools such as **log clustering** and **pattern matching** are useful. They assist you in discovering common patterns of failure across multiple runs. Professional teams even possess **AI/ML models** that group similar failures automatically and tag probable root causes.
    
* You could also apply structured techniques like **5 Whys**, **fishbone diagrams**, or **orthogonal defect** **classification** to dig deeper into difficult issues. Comparing test failure to recent code changes and finding out who changed the code are also highly effective methods.
    
* Tools like **ReportPortal** can do better yet - automatically assigning duplicate issues, routing them to the appropriate members of the team, and saving triage time. The objective? Fix smarter, not merely quicker.
    

## Better Build Runs & Test Suites Management for More Insights

As your testing becomes larger and more complex, it's imperative to have it methodically structured. Brilliantly arranged test data doesn't just make life simpler to handle - it releases insightful information. Begin by **recording metadata** such as the branch, commit hash, environment, and build number. That allows you to cut and slice test results any which way you want - by release version, team, or feature area.

![Better Build Runs & Test Suites Management for More Insights](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1754476130324/0c4b1d2c-9c84-4ec4-833e-22755fe7f12a.png align="center")

Organize your tests into **suites** or test sets like [**smoke tests**](https://keploy.io/blog/community/developers-guide-to-smoke-testing-ensuring-basic-functionality), **regression packs**, **API tests**, **UI automation**, or **performance benchmarks**. Every suite can have a specific objective and potentially a different schedule or priority level.Common practice is for modern test platforms to include **filterable dashboards** by which you choose and examine test results on multiple axes. Here are some trends that you might consider investigating:

* Which branches are experiencing the highest failure rates?
    
* Are UI tests failing more frequently in staging than dev?
    
* How long each test suite is taking to run with time?
    

By examining these metrics - e.g., "failure rate per branch" or "suite duration over the last 30 builds" - you can catch regressions before it's too late, remove flakiness, and streamline your pipeline.

## Upload JUnit XML Reports using API

Contemporary testing boards and tools facilitate seamless automated test report uploading, especially in JUnit XML, a de facto standard for CI/CD pipelines.The majority of frameworks contain a particular API or CLI command that facilitates importing test results directly, without the requirement of Upload buttons. Such tools generally accommodate more metadata within the XML, such as:

* `Priority`, `Owner`, or `Environment` custom tags to help categorize tests
    
* Bulk uploads in the event of large test suites or **distributed runners** outcomes (e.g., cloud-parallelized tests in cloud environment)
    

You can also get these uploads into your CI pipelines through webhooks, or by pushing the reports as build artifacts. Whether you're accomplishing it using Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or a cloud runner, this way you're having your test data running automatically into your reporting system - keeping it all in one place and current.This is an on-prem + cloud hybrid environment team simplifier for games. It reduces the overhead associated with real-time manual effort and provides better analysis of tests, as well as smarter insights.

![XML Report and Channel alert](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1754478338028/a5afced8-26f6-4d23-b98c-b5f00e6ed834.png align="center")

## Set up Email & Channel Alerts

Even the most detailed test report in the world is pointless if nobody ever looks at it. That’s why it’s worth setting up real-time alerts — the kind that actually reach people when it matters, not an hour later when the damage is done.

With the right setup in place, your team can get things like:

* **A quick summary email for each run** — total tests, passes/fails, a heads-up on flaky tests, and a snapshot of the whole suite
    
* **Slack or Microsoft Teams pings via webhooks** when a run fails, a threshold is crossed, or the same nasty bug keeps showing up
    
* **Quality gates in your CI pipeline** that stop merges cold if core metrics dip below your standards (say, more than 5% failures or dropping coverage)
    

The idea here is simple: you shouldn’t have to babysit dashboards all day. You’ll only hear from the system when there’s something worth acting on, which keeps the noise down and everyone in sync. Over time, that habit builds a team culture of fast reaction and consistent quality — exactly what modern DevOps needs to thrive.

## Visualization: Simplifying Test Data and Making It Easy to Understand

While in managing big test data volumes, visualization is the solution to simplifying complicated results easy to read and usable conclusions. A storybook dashboard, as opposed to a mere data reporting. Modern test report software employs rich multifaceted visual paradigms to enable teams to receive what is happening as fast as possible:

* **Pie charts and bar charts** at a glance take in passed vs. failed test, skipped case, or flaky result proportion.
    
* **Heatmaps** pinpoint areas of concern - tests repeatedly flaky or slow - so you can prioritize more quickly.
    
* **Timelines or trend graphs** indicate failure patterns by time (daily, weekly, by release), so you can detect regressions earlier.
    
* **Code coverage overlays provide context:** Are flaky tests covering the most important code paths? Do we want more coverage in risky areas?
    
* **Drill-downs** - such as more verbose logs, step-by-step executions, and captured screenshots - allow engineers to debug quicker without digging through tools.
    

With proper visual styles, your test reports are no longer pass/fail totals - you start making decisions and keep iterating based on them.

## Common Reporting Styles & Convenient Documents

While live dashboards serve well in normal work, static reports and shareable documents remain in order for review, audit, and stakeholder reporting.

![Common Reporting Styles](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1753178687720/375083aa-bb66-4f65-84b5-54f773ca426e.png align="center")

Most modern test tools spit out a range of formats suitable for their particular purposes:

* **Interactive HTML dashboards** (such as ExtentReports or Allure) offer graphical overviews, team tasking, and screenshot-insertion - all within one window.
    
* **Trend reports**, usually being an email sent in HTML or PDF form, are appropriate for monitoring test results through a series of builds. Release retrospectives or quality audits are the ideal applications for them.
    
* API-based **real-time dashboards** (e.g., Tesults or ReportPortal) provide ongoing analytics and alerting without requiring refreshing.
    
* **Requirement-mapped reports**, made possible with tools such as TestRail or XRay, promote traceability - connecting test cases with user stories, Jira tickets, or feature requirements directly. They are of greatest use in regulated or enterprise QA environments.
    

Such reports and dashboards not only facilitate internal transparency but also become pre-deployed artifacts for stakeholder presentations, compliance audits, and ongoing quality monitoring.

## Test Reporting & Analytics – Why It’s Worth the Effort

These days, software moves fast. Really fast. If your testing reports only tell you “pass” or “fail,” you’re already behind. The real value comes when those reports tell a story - the kind of story that helps you fix problems before they turn into customer complaints. That’s where proper reporting and analytics shine.

A few examples from the trenches:

* **Finding problems quicker** – When the report shows you the same failure cropping up over and over, and it’s already got the screenshot, the stack trace, and the log snippet right there, you don’t waste an afternoon digging through files.
    
* **Spotting flaky tests** – Every team has them. They pass on Monday, fail on Tuesday, and make everyone doubt the results. Flagging those early keeps the whole pipeline calmer.
    
* **Seeing the health of the pipeline** – Over time, you notice which tests are always slow, which ones keep failing, and which stages are a bit too fragile for comfort.
    
* **Looking at the bigger picture** – It’s not just about today’s run. Patterns over weeks or months -regressions, slowdowns, recurring bugs - tell you a lot about where things are heading.
    
* **Retrying the right way** – Instead of re-running everything, you just re-run the flaky ones. Saves time, saves frustration.
    
* **Getting an early nudge** – If performance starts dipping, failure rates creep up, or quality gates are in danger, you get a heads-up before it hits production.
    
* **Making smarter calls** – Test data isn’t just for QA. It tells you where the gaps are, what needs attention first, and how to plan the next sprint.
    

When you start treating analytics as part of your quality strategy - not just a side task - your test suite stops being a checkbox and starts becoming one of the most useful tools you have.

## What Makes a Test Report Actually Useful?

Okay, so here’s the deal - a test report isn’t just a bunch of green ticks and red crosses. It’s kinda like a story that tells you what went wrong, where, and hopefully why. And yeah, how to fix that mess. Your team needs that one go-to spot for figuring out bugs, checking how things worked, or just looking back later on.

Now, what should you find in a good report? Let me tell you what really helps:

* First, every test needs a clear ID or name. Otherwise, good luck finding which test did what.
    
* It’s gotta show if tests passed, failed, or got skipped - and how long they took. That way you can spot the slow or flaky ones that drive you nuts.
    
* You want to know the setup - like what OS, browser, or device was used, and which build it ran on. Some bugs only happen in weird combos, trust me.
    
* When stuff breaks, the report should give you logs, stack traces, and if you’re lucky, screenshots or videos. Saves hours of guessing what actually went wrong.
    
* Tags are cool too - like how serious the failure is, who’s in charge of the test, what feature it’s for, or what kind of test it is (smoke, regression, performance, whatever).
    
* And don’t forget to compare with past runs. Are failures stacking up? Tests slowing down? Coverage shrinking? That kind of stuff is gold for figuring out what’s up over time.
    

Put all this in one place, and suddenly your report isn’t just a boring checklist. It’s something that helps your team fix stuff faster, keeps things open and clear, and helps you get better bit by bit.

## Conclusion

Look, nowadays, you just can’t skip **test reporting and analytics**. It’s not optional. Raw test results sitting there? Useless unless someone uses them.Good reports and automated analysis mean you catch problems early, not at the last minute when everyone’s panicking. It’s about moving from always fixing bugs to actually stopping them before they happen.

That builds trust in your whole build and deploy system - no more last-second surprises. And when your tests pile up, they stop being a chore and actually become a real advantage. You ship better stuff, faster, and with less stress.

## FAQs

1. ### **What is the difference between test reporting and test analytics?**
    
    Test reporting is focused on reporting the result of test runs (pass/fail/skip, logs, screenshots). Test analytics is more engaged by analyzing trends over time - flaky test trends, failure rates, regression detection, etc. - for better decision-making and test quality.
    
2. ### **What is the best test reporting tool for small teams or starters?**
    
    For small teams, Allure TestOps or ExtentReports with a CI such as GitHub Actions or Jenkins is an excellent starting point. They provide rich, graphical, user-friendly reporting with sufficient insight into day-to-day debugging and optimization.
    
3. ### **How can I improve flaky test handling using test reports?**
    
    Most modern utilities indicate and alert flaky tests from past run data. For features, check for flaky test monitoring, re-run policy, and exclusion by tag (e.g., ReportPortal, Testmo). Pair that with root cause clustering for enhanced diagnosis.
    
4. ### **Can I merge test reports into Jira or Slack?**
    
    Yes! All the new reporting tools support webhooks or native integration with Slack, Jira, MS Teams, etc.Leverage them for sending failure alerts, automatic ticket creation, or notification to certain owners in case of high-priority failures.
    
5. ### **How often should I check test analytics dashboards?**
    
    Best practice: Incorporate it into your everyday CI/CD check. At least check trends following each sprint or major release to monitor stability, regressions, and coverage gaps to make sure your testing practice continues to get better.
    

### FAQs

1. ### **What’s test reporting vs test analytics?**
    
    Test reporting = basic pass/fail/skip + logs/screenshots.  
    Test analytics = looking at trends over time - flaky tests, failure rates, regressions. Helps figure out what needs fixing.
    
2. ### **Best reporting tool for small teams or starters?**
    
    Try Allure TestOps or ExtentReports + GitHub Actions or Jenkins. Easy to set up, decent visuals, good enough for daily debugging.
    
3. ### **How to handle flaky tests better?**
    
    Look for tools that flag flaky tests from history, auto retry flaky ones, or let you tag and skip them. ReportPortal and Testmo do this well. Group errors to find root causes faster.
    
4. ### **Can I hook test reports to Jira or Slack?**
    
    Yep, most tools have webhooks or built-in integrations. Alerts, tickets, pings - all automated for failures or important stuff.
    
5. ### **How often check analytics dashboards?**
    
    Make it a habit. After each sprint or big release, check for failures, coverage gaps, or slow tests. Keeps your testing sharp
