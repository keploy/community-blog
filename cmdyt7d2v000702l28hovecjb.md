Coding isn't just a chore anymore - it is an experience. With the rise and advancement of AI-driven coding tools, developers are now able to enjoy what Andrej Karpathy calls "vibe coding" - a state where we turn off our control and let the tools vibe with us. In this blog post we are going to discuss how we can tap into vibe coding to ship faster, feel creative, and stay in flow.

If you are sick of rigid workflows, manual dependencies, and falling into the debugging rabbit hole, then you're in the right place. Let's see how you can build your full stack apps based on a thought, good music, and some AI copilots.

## **What Is Vibe Coding?**

Vibe coding is a mindset that welcomes AI-assisted coding, low-friction workflows and an emphasis on outcomes rather than processes. Instead of outlining every nuance beforehand, developers start with intent and leverage tools—such as ChatGPT, Copilot, and Keploy—to help [generate code](https://keploy.io/blog/community/best-free-ai-code-generators#what-is-an-ai-code-generator), user interface (UI) and automated tests in real time.

Key principles of vibe coding include:

* Leverage AI copilots to generate code and explicate intent
    
* Rapidly iterate from idea to deployed
    
* Keep attention and flow by instigating distractions
    
* Generate test cases automatically with tools like Keploy
    

## **How Vibe Coding Aligns With Modern Developer Needs**

Traditional coding often involves:

* A lot of copy-and-paste work, also known as boilerplate work
    
* Manual Test Cases
    
* Navigating between a multitude of tools used for debugging, testing and validating.
    

Vibe coding simplifies this by:

* Utilizing prompt-based UIs such as v0.dev and Tempo.dev
    
* Having ChatGPT create the logic and subsequently refactor the logic
    
* Having Keploy generate [test cases](https://keploy.io/blog/community/a-guide-to-test-cases-in-software-testing) automatically for APIs, integrations and units.
    

The outcome? Less wasted human energy and exponentially more good output.

## **The Vibe Coding Tech Stack**

Here’s a curated stack for developers who want to embrace vibe coding:

### **Prompt-to-App Platforms**

* **v0.dev** – Turn UI prompts into responsive components
    
* **Tempo.dev** – Build full-stack apps from product ideas
    
* **Replit** – Code and deploy entirely in the browser with AI
    

### **AI Copilots**

* **GitHub Copilot** – Autocomplete with context-aware suggestions
    
* **Cursor.sh** – GPT-native code editor
    
* **ChatGPT** – Great for debugging, refactoring, and scaffolding projects
    

### **Testing With the Vibe**

* **Keploy** – Auto-generate and validate API, integration, and unit tests from real traffic
    
* **Codeium** – Lightweight AI suggestion engine
    
* **Jest + Keploy** – Generate test snapshots and mock server states
    

## **Using Keploy in the Vibe Coding Workflow**

Vibe coding moves fast. But that doesn't mean you can skip testing. Here's how Keploy helps you keep up without breaking flow:

![Vibe Coding](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1754396887534/fd2b2f10-8f57-4e8b-994b-f8212f7f5d14.png align="center")

### **1\. Passive API Test Generation**

Just run your app locally or during integration testing. Keploy captures API calls and auto-generates test cases, including inputs, outputs, and mocks.

### **2\. Regression Testing on the Fly**

Want to validate if the latest feature broke something? Run previously captured tests with a single command—no need to rewrite or re-record.

### **3\. AI-Generated Unit Tests**

Keploy can use LLMs to generate unit tests for your codebase, filtering out test cases that:

* Don’t compile
    
* Don’t add coverage
    
* Are flaky or inconsistent
    

You stay in vibe; Keploy handles the guardrails.

## **Real-World Example: Building With the Vibe**

Let’s say you want to build a project dashboard with GitHub auth and task tracking.

**Step 1:** Prompt ChatGPT to scaffold a basic Next.js project  
**Step 2:** Use v0.dev to generate your UI  
**Step 3:** Let ChatGPT or Supabase handle backend APIs  
**Step 4:** Run the app with Keploy running in the background to capture API tests  
**Step 5:** Use Keploy to replay test cases every time you make a change  
**Step 6:** Deploy to Vercel and test with confidence

No context switching. No manual test-writing. Just flow.

## **Why Developers Are Embracing This Approach**

Vibe coding helps you:

* Avoid burnout from over-engineering
    
* Get feedback faster via rapid iteration
    
* Focus on creative problem-solving, not setup
    

And with tools like Keploy in your corner, you don’t have to sacrifice quality for speed.

## **Common Pitfalls and How To Avoid Them**

**Over-relying on AI without validation**  
Use Keploy to verify inputs/outputs and replay them consistently.

**Messy codebases due to lack of structure**  
Use prompt chaining to instruct AI on how to structure folders and components.

**No test coverage**  
Let Keploy auto-generate test coverage reports and test cases.

## **Vibe Coding Is the Future—Keploy Makes It Testable**

We're moving into a new era of software development; instead of spending hours writing test cases, setting up [mock](https://keploy.io/blog/community/mock-vs-stub-vs-fake-understand-the-difference) servers, and debugging edge cases manually, developers can now create more, iterate more, and code with more confidence.

Vibe coding lets you get quick feedback and build momentum but this only works if your tests are in sync.

This is where Keploy fits in perfectly. It automates creating tests, applies consistency across environments, and easily plugs into your stack whether you're working with Next.js, Spring Boot or Express.

## **Conclusion**

Vibe coding is about trusting your gut, leveraging AI, and getting a product out of your head without introducing unnecessary complexity into your flow. And with tools like [Keploy](https://keploy.io/) in your integration of flow, testing is no longer a blocker—it just happens.

Whether you're prototyping your side hustle or making something at scale, vibe coding allows you to focus on your product—not the process.
