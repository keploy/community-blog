## Top 3 Must-Have Python IDE Extensions to use in 2025

Although choosing the right IDE is important, but choosing the right IDE extensions can also significantly enhance your productivity and streamline your workflow. Let’s check some of the popular extensions that you should must use:

### 1\. [Keploy](https://keploy.io/)

Keploy is a powerful IDE extension that can automatically generate test cases by recording real-time [API](https://keploy.io/api-testing) calls during the development phase. By providing a zero-code way to capture test data, it ensures that your application is covered with functional tests without writing additional code. Also the replay feature of Keploy enables you to run these tests and ensure no unintended behavior creeps into your codebase after updates.

![Vscode extension](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1759135480488/21b6a730-edbe-4266-8d77-8e9abac280bb.png align="center")

**Key Benefits**:

* Zero-code [functional test generation](https://keploy.io/unit-test-generator)
    
* Automated API regression testing
    
* Seamless integration into CI/CD pipelines
    

### 2\. Docker

The [Docke](https://keploy.io/blog/community/podman-vs-docker)r extension brings the power of [containerized development directly](https://keploy.io/blog/technology/secure-your-database-communications-with-ssl-in-docker-containers-learn-to-set-up-ssl-for-mongodb-and-postgresql-efficiently) into your IDE. These containers ensure that your application runs consistently across different environments, eliminating the classic "***works on my machine***" problem. With the Docker extension, it becomes simpler for us to manage containers, images, and networks right from our editor, making development and testing environments incredibly flexible and easy.
