The software reliability lies in testing. However, in the vast majority of teams such writing and maintenance of tests is difficult, time-consuming and tends to be placed on the lowest priority on the backlog. The challenge we experienced in our team was not a new one--until we found [Keploy,](http://www.keploy.io) the open-source test automation framework that changed all of our thoughts about testing.

In this post we shall walk you through:

* We had the issue of manual testing.
    
* That is how Keploy allowed us to reach 80%+ [test coverage.](https://keploy.io/blog/community/mastering-test-coverage-quality-over-quantity-in-software-testing)
    
* How specifically we did this to merge Keploy.
    
* The outcome, the lessons and the reasons we believe Keploy is the future of testing APIs.
    

Let’s dive in

# **The Pain of Manual Testing**

Our backend development was becoming quite large-scale-a number of services, high release productivity and time constraints. Although we had fundamental unit testing, our integration testing plans and [end-to-end testing](https://keploy.io/blog/technology/automated-end-to-end-tests-using-property-based-testing-part-i) plans were lax. Which resulted in:

* Poor consistency in test coverage of services.
    
* Repeated bugs during both staging and production.
    
* Frustration of the developers when writing and maintaining tests.
    
* The failure to be able to release when there is no assurance of untested code.
    

![Frustrated developer with caption: Manual Testing Hurts. Automate the Pain Away](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1751011069387/6c9a3f61-712c-4598-907e-d61a2448b73b.png align="center")

We attempted scaling [manual testing](https://keploy.io/blog/community/why-manual-testing-matters-a-ultimate-guide-to-software-testing) by bringing in more QA, and even dipping in test automation frameworks. However, these solutions could not sustain our engineering velocity.

This is when we discovered Keploy.

## **What is Keploy?**

**Keploy is an open-source tool that generates test cases from real API traffic.**

It works by capturing actual requests and responses during runtime and converting them into:

* **Test cases** (inputs + expected outputs)
    
* **Mocks** of downstream dependencies like databases, internal services, or third-party APIs
    

Keploy removes the need to write tests manually. Instead, you test by doing—just run your application normally, and Keploy will **record your real interactions as reusable tests.**

Think of it as [**record-and-replay**](https://keploy.io/blog/community/know-about-record-and-replay-testing)**, but for backend testing.**

![Keploy banner](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1751008474453/4b1cf761-479a-4e89-b033-15f4b5d34e33.jpeg align="center")

## **Why We Chose Keploy**

Keploy emerged as the best since most tools available such as Postman tests, Jest, Mocha, and [Cypress](https://keploy.io/blog/community/supercharge-your-testing-5-free-cypress-ai-tools-that-actually-work) to test APIs could not assist me due to the following reasons:

* No handwriting of tests
    
* Real user-based test cases that can be played again and again
    
* One go of test + mock generation
    
* Open-source (which fits perfectly our stack and our customization requirements)
    
* Developer-first design principle: fit in the trusted dev process, not modify it.
    

We recognized that the possibilities are quite substantial, in terms of increased test coverage with no dev effort to match. We felt like we had been missing its component of our testing.

## **Our Integration Setup with Keploy**

Here’s how we integrated Keploy into our workflow, step-by-step:

![Step-by-step Keploy integration: install, record, replay, analyze](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1751009191753/6aec344c-99f6-4e3d-b784-a3986499c5ce.png align="center")

### **1.  Install Keploy**

We added Keploy as a sidecar container in our local development and staging environments. This allowed it to intercept HTTP traffic without modifying app code.

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name keploy \
  -p 16789:16789 \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  keploy/keploy
```

We also used SDKs for Go and [Node.js](https://keploy.io/blog/community/mastering-node-js-backend-testing-with-mocha-and-chai) depending on the service.

### **2.  Run the Application with Keploy**

Next, we ran the app with Keploy in **record mode**. During this time, we simply used the app like a user would (via Postman or frontend interactions). Keploy started capturing requests, responses, and mocks.

```bash
keploy record --path ./app
```

Within minutes, we had:

* Dozens of test cases generated
    
* Automatically captured database and service mocks
    
* Zero extra work from the devs
    

### **3\. Replay Tests in CI/CD**

Once tests were generated, Keploy made them replayable in any environment. We configured our [CI/CD](https://keploy.io/blog/community/how-cicd-is-changing-the-future-of-software-development) to run:

```bash
keploy test --path ./app
```

This replays the tests using mocks to verify the backend logic without depending on real DBs or services.

Every commit now triggers a **reliable test suite with &gt;80% coverage**.

### **4\. Analyze Coverage**

Keploy gave us detailed reports of what endpoints were tested, what wasn’t, and even what mocks were missing. This made it easy to:

* Identify untested APIs
    
* Track [test coverage](https://keploy.io/blog/community/top-8-code-coverage-tools-for-free-a-developers-guide-to-smarter-testing) over time
    
* Improve coverage by using the app normally
    

## **Real Results: 80%+ Test Coverage in Days**

Within the **first week**, we saw dramatic improvements:

| **Metric** | **Before Keploy** | **After Keploy** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Test Coverage | ~25% | **80%+** |
| Manual Test Code | Thousands of lines | **0 lines** |
| CI Test Time | 20+ mins | **~5 mins** |
| Bug Reports Post-Release | Frequent | **Reduced by 60%** |

The best part? Our developers didn’t have to become test engineers. They just used the app, and Keploy did the rest.

## **What Worked Well**

1. Frictionless Developer Experience  
    No one likes writing tests. Keploy removed the biggest blocker: dev time. Just run the app → get tests.
    
2. High-Fidelity Testing  
    Since tests came from real API traffic, they covered actual user behavior—not just edge cases developers imagined.
    
3. Service Mocking Without Code  
    Keploy automatically mocked dependencies like Redis, external APIs, and internal services. No need to mock manually.
    
4. CI Integration  
    We plugged Keploy into GitHub Actions. Every PR now runs a full suite of [API tests](https://keploy.io/blog/community/everything-you-need-to-know-about-api-testing) based on real user traffic.
    

## **Things to Watch Out For**

1. Initial Test Management  
    You may need to prune some test cases if noise is captured during exploratory testing.
    
2. Mock Updates  
    When downstream services change their responses, you’ll need to regenerate mocks to stay in sync.
    
3. High Volume Services  
    For high-traffic services, filtering and grouping tests is helpful to manage test size.
    

## **Tips to Get the Most Out of Keploy**

* Mock postman collections or frontend tests to occur realistic user behavior throughout record mode.
    
* Embedded Keploy in the pre-production/ staging environment to allow greater coverage.
    
* Place periodic test refresh so that the test case is regenerated with the evolution of your app.
    
* Use Keploy test reports to identify endpoints that you have not tested and increase test generation priority.
    

## **Why Keploy is a Game-Changer**

Keploy isn’t just another test tool—it redefines how we think about backend testing. By flipping the model from “write tests” to “capture real usage,” Keploy:

* Empowers developers to ship confidently
    
* Gives teams **instant test coverage**
    
* Reduces dependency on QA teams for regression testing
    
* Helps shift testing left in the dev cycle
    

In short, Keploy allows us to **test more, write less, and ship faster.**
