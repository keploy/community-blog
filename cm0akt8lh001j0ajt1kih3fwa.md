## **What is Smoke Testing**

**Smoke Testing**, often referred to asÂ **"build verification testing"**, is a type of software testing that verifies whether the major functionalities of an application are working correctly after a new build. It's like performing a quick "sanity check" to ensure the product is stable enough for further, more detailed testing.

> ðŸ“Œ Think of it as turning on a newly built car engine just to see if it starts â€” you're not taking it for a spin yet.

![Functional Testing](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeNCXwLJ98m_6rKfl-gycSgYrcxqzfNLTJ_6quCcLGbqlef1_eVgsJ_KImxO5Jbxi44TAGXa1EZGEslZSgDASdFiwjwbXyvl3S_aVDAtX-x-3YH4lQVr9q1KuOE8fM2sKW6IqzKzOHK1vtLy5vCG-uNDgC6?key=d59HrjaIAdNmaLdo6SDmnQ align="left")

Smoke tests assess whether the essential functionalities of an application or system are operating correctly. For instance:

* Does the software launch without issues?
    
* Can the user successfully log in?
    
* Are the primary features available and functional?
    

### **Key Functions of Smoke Testing:**

* **Verifying Build Stability:** Smoke tests confirm that the software build is stable and that there are no major issues that would prevent further testing.
    
* **Detecting Showstopper Bugs:** The primary goal is to identify critical issues early on, which could halt the progress of the project.
    
* **Saving Time and Resources:** By catching major defects early, smoke testing helps avoid wasting time on a flawed build.
    

![Smoke testing process](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1744955275322/b9876fd1-2807-46d8-8d9d-bc1a45327ac5.png align="center")

## **Why Do We Need Smoke Testing?**

Smoke testing is essential for several reasons, all of which contribute to a smoother, more efficient development process.

#### **1\. Early Detection of Critical Issues**

Smoke testing acts as the first filter to catch critical defects in the software and to address them before they cause more complex problems down the line.

#### **2\. Increased Efficiency in Development**

Smoke testing ensures that only stable builds proceed to more detailed testing phases as teams might waste valuable time and resources conducting in-depth testing on a build that has fundamental issues.

#### **3\. Improved Quality Assurance**

Smoke testing adds an additional layer of quality assurance by ensuring that the most basic and crucial functionalities work as intended to build confidence in the overall stability of the application.

#### **4\. Faster Feedback Loop**

By incorporating smoke testing into your development process, you create a faster feedback loop. Developers can quickly determine whether a build is viable or needs immediate attention, allowing for more agile and responsive development.

#### 5\. Gatekeeper to Further Testing

Smoke testing acts as aÂ **filter or gatekeeper**. If the build fails smoke tests, itâ€™s returned to the developers for fixes. If it passes, it proceeds toÂ **comprehensive testing**Â likeÂ **unit tests**,Â **functional testing**, orÂ **acceptance testing**.

## Goal of Smoke Testing

The purpose of performing smoke tests isnâ€™t to validate every functionality, but to ensure that the application is stable enough for deeper testing. Here are the detailed goals:

* **Early Identification of Critical Issues**  
    By verifyingÂ **critical paths**Â (like logins, data fetches, and API calls) right after deployment, smoke testing allows teams toÂ **catch major bugs**Â or configuration issues early, before wasting time on deeperÂ **QA efforts**.
    
* **Validate Major Functionalities**  
    Smoke tests confirm thatÂ **high-priority features**Â are functioning as expected. For example, in a mobile app, the smoke test might check whether the app launches, users can log in, and the main menu renders correctly, allÂ **critical functionalities**Â for user access.
    
* **Minimize Wasted QA Time**  
    Instead of proceeding with hundreds ofÂ **regression or exploratory test cases**, QA teams first run smoke tests. If these fail, the build is immediately rejected, saving hours (or days) of unnecessary testing on a broken build.
    
* **Serve as a Quality Checkpoint**  
    A passed smoke test essentially gives the green light that the build is stable and ready forÂ **detailed testing**. It plays a crucial role inÂ **release management**, acting as the first checkpoint in theÂ **software quality assurance (QA) pipeline**.
    

## When and Who Performs Smoke Testing?

![When is smoke testing performed](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1744955527553/fe18a4f8-356a-4f18-83de-51db24e92dc5.png align="center")

Letâ€™s break down the timeline and roles associated withÂ **smoke testing**:

### When Is Smoke Testing Performed?

* **After Every New Build Deployment**  
    As soon as a new build is pushed to a QA or staging environment, a smoke test is run to validate its basic stability.
    
* **Before Regression or System Testing**  
    It acts as aÂ **gatekeeper**Â before more extensive test suites are executed.
    
* **During Continuous Integration Pipelines**  
    In CI/CD environments, smoke tests are triggeredÂ **automatically**Â to ensure the build can safely move to the next pipeline stage.
    

### Who Performs Smoke Testing?

* **QA Engineers**  
    Responsible for executingÂ **manual or automated smoke tests**, especially in structured testing teams.
    
* **Developers**  
    Often run basicÂ **unit-level smoke tests**Â to check if their code breaks the application before passing it to QA.
    
* **Automation Engineers**  
    In CI/CD pipelines,Â **automation engineers**Â script smoke test suites that run with every build commit or PR merge.
    

## Why You Need Smoke Tests

If you're still unsure about implementing smoke tests in your software development workflow, here are key reasons why youÂ **must**:

* **Catch Major Issues Quickly**  
    A broken login page, crashing app, or unreachable API should never make it to production.Â **Smoke testing**Â ensures that theseÂ **showstopper issues**Â are caught early.
    
* **Maintain Stability in Rapid Development**  
    In modern agile and DevOps workflows, multiple code changes are made daily. Smoke tests act as aÂ **quick quality assurance checkpoint**Â before going deeper.
    
* **Validate Critical Paths First**  
    Core workflows like login, dashboard access, and data fetching are vital for users. Smoke testing ensures these are always functional, even when smaller bugs are present.
    
* **Support Agile and Continuous Delivery**  
    Smoke tests provideÂ **immediate feedback**Â on the build status and integrate well withÂ **continuous deployment**Â andÂ **automated testing tools**.
    
* **Improve Product Quality with Less Effort**  
    Smoke testing isÂ **low effort, high return**Â catchingÂ **critical bugs**Â early reduces the cost and time associated with fixing them later.
    

## **Real-World Scenario: The Launch of a New Mobile Banking App**

Imagine you're a developer working on a new mobile banking app. This app is designed to handle everything from simple balance checks to complex transactions like fund transfers and bill payments.

Before releasing a new build for extensive testing or for use by beta testers, you need to ensure that the core functions are operational. This is where smoke testing comes into play.

### Steps to apply smoke testing

1. **Core Functions Check:**
    
    * **User Login:** First, you check if users can log in securely. Without a functional login system, users cannot access the app, rendering all other features useless.
        
    * **Balance Check:** Next, verify that users can view their account balance. This is one of the most fundamental features of any banking app.
        
    * **Fund Transfer:** Ensure that the fund transfer functionality is working, as this is a critical transaction process that must not fail.
        
2. **Basic Navigation:**
    
    * **Menu Navigation:** Test if users can navigate through the app's menu to reach different sections like "Account Summary," "Transaction History," and "Settings."
        
    * **Notifications:** Check if the app sends essential notifications, such as low balance alerts or payment due reminders, to the user.
        
3. **Stability Verification:**
    
    * **No Crashes:** The app must not crash during these basic operations. A stable build is essential before moving on to more detailed testing.
        

![Module Flow](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1723442820067/b80d2655-5894-4fe5-a71d-58ef22bf923e.png align="left")

## **Types of Smoke Testing**

### 1\. Build Verification Testing (BVT):

* **Overview:**
    
    * Build Verification Testing, often considered synonymous with smoke testing, involves verifying the integrity of the build. It ensures that the critical functionalities of the software are operational after the build process.
        
* **When to Use:**
    
    * Perform BVT immediately after a new build is created to catch any major issues before they propagate further into the testing cycle.
        
* **Example:**
    
    * In a healthcare application, BVT would ensure that core functions like patient registration, appointment scheduling, and medical record access are all working before moving forward.
        

### 2\. Sanity Smoke Testing:

* **Overview:**
    
    * Sanity smoke testing is a narrow, focused test performed after receiving a software build with minor changes or bug fixes. It checks whether the specific functionality that was recently added or fixed is working as expected.
        
* **When to Use:**
    
    * Use this type of smoke testing when you receive a build that includes minor changes or bug fixes, ensuring those updates haven't broken existing functionality.
        
* **Example:**
    
    * After fixing a bug in an e-learning platformâ€™s quiz module, sanity smoke testing would check if the quiz functionality is now working correctly without affecting the rest of the system.
        

### 3\. Acceptance Smoke Testing:

* **Overview:**
    
    * Acceptance smoke testing is performed to determine whether the software meets the acceptance criteria defined by stakeholders. Itâ€™s usually done before the software is handed over for user acceptance testing (UAT).
        
* **When to Use:**
    
    * Use this before transitioning to UAT to confirm that the software meets the basic requirements and is ready for more thorough testing by the end users.
        
* **Example:**
    
    * For a retail application, acceptance smoke testing would ensure that users can browse products, add items to the cart, and complete the checkout process without any issues.
        

### 4\. Manual Smoke Testing:

* **Overview:**
    
    * Manual smoke testing involves testers manually executing test cases to verify the basic functionalities of the software. This type is often used when automation isnâ€™t feasible or when the software is in the early stages of development.
        
* **When to Use:**
    
    * Use manual smoke testing when you need to test user interfaces, new features, or complex workflows that require human observation.
        
* **Example:**
    
    * A banking application might undergo manual smoke testing to ensure that users can log in, view their account balances, and perform transactions correctly.
        

### 5\. Automated Smoke Testing:

* **Overview:**
    
    * Automated smoke testing uses scripts and tools to automatically execute test cases, making it faster and more efficient than manual testing. Itâ€™s particularly useful for large projects with frequent builds.
        
* **When to Use:**
    
    * Use automated smoke testing in continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to quickly validate each build.
        
* **Example:**
    
    * In a CI/CD environment, an automated smoke test could run after every code commit, checking if core functions like login, data retrieval, and API endpoints are working correctly.
        

## How Can the Smoke Testing Procedure Be Automated?

**Automating smoke tests**Â enhances efficiency, consistency, and speed, especially in CI/CD pipelines. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Identify Critical Test Cases**  
    Choose high-priority test cases that cover the mostÂ **critical functionalities**Â of the application (e.g., login, database connection, dashboard load).
    
2. **Use Automation Tools**  
    Implement tools likeÂ **Selenium**, **Keploy,**Â **Cypress**,Â **Playwright**, orÂ **JUnit/TestNG**. These tools support scripting and scheduling automated smoke tests.
    
3. **Integrate with CI/CD Pipelines**  
    Integrate your smoke test scripts into CI tools likeÂ **Jenkins**,Â **GitLab CI**,Â **CircleCI**, orÂ **GitHub Actions**Â so tests run automatically on every code push or pull request.
    
4. **Generate Reports Automatically**  
    Use reporting tools likeÂ **Allure**,Â **ExtentReports**, or native test framework reports to get real-time feedback onÂ **build health**Â andÂ **test results**.
    

## Smoke Testing vs. Sanity Testing

Smoke testing and sanity testing are both surface-level testing techniques used to validate builds but they serveÂ **different purposes**Â at different stages of the testing process. Letâ€™s explore each.

### What is Sanity Testing?

**Sanity testing**Â is a narrow and focused testing approach performed after minor bug fixes or changes to ensure that specific functionalities are working as expected without introducing new issues.

#### Key Characteristics:

* **Focus**: Validates a small section of functionality (e.g., checking if a fixed login issue now works).
    
* **Scope**: Narrow and deep.
    
* **Performed After**: Minor code changes or patches.
    
* **Speed**: Quick but targeted.
    
* **Who Performs It**: QA engineers or testers.
    
* **Test Basis**: Often undocumented or informal.
    
* **Objective**: To validate the correctness of newly added functionality or bug fixes without conducting a full regression cycle.
    

### Differences Between Sanity Testing and Smoke Testing

| **Criteria** | **Smoke Testing** | **Sanity Testing** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Purpose** | To verify the overall stability of a new build | To verify specific functionalities after bug fixes or changes |
| **Performed When** | After receiving a new build | After a minor change or bug fix |
| **Test Scope** | Broad and shallow | Narrow and deep |
| **Test Cases** | Covers critical system functionality | Focuses on specific modules or features |
| **Documentation** | Often uses predefined scripts | Often informal or ad-hoc |
| **Automation** | Frequently automated as part of CI/CD | Typically manual and quick |
| **Goal** | To accept or reject a build for further testing | To verify specific fixes or enhancements |
| **Example** | Does the app launch, log in, and open the dashboard? | Was the bug in the payment page fixed without breaking anything else? |

Both types of tests areÂ **non-exhaustive**Â and aim to save time but they are applied inÂ **different scenarios**Â during the software testing life cycle.

## Smoke Testing vs. Regression Testing

WhileÂ **smoke testing**Â checks if the application is stable enough for further testing,Â **regression testing**Â ensures that newly introduced changes haven't broken existing features.

### Key Differences:

| **Criteria** | **Smoke Testing** | **Regression Testing** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Goal** | Quickly assess build stability | Confirm existing functionality hasnâ€™t broken due to new changes |
| **Scope** | High-level, critical features only | Full or partial application coverage |
| **Frequency** | Done on every new build | Done after code changes, bug fixes, or enhancements |
| **Time Required** | Fast, usually completed in minutes | Time-consuming depending on the number of test cases |
| **Automation** | Can be automated or manual | Highly recommended to automate due to its size |
| **Execution Order** | Performed before other test types | Performed after passing smoke/sanity tests |
| **Result** | Accept/reject the build | Ensure software remains reliable after changes |
| **Example** | Can the user log in and view the dashboard? | Do all previous features still work after updating the login module? |

### Summary:

* UseÂ **smoke testing**Â as an entry point to testing.
    
* UseÂ **sanity testing**Â after small fixes or updates.
    
* UseÂ **regression testing**Â to maintain long-term application reliability.
    

## Advantages of Smoke Testing

Smoke testing offers several advantages that enhance both development and QA efficiency:

* **Early Detection of Critical Bugs**  
    Smoke tests are designed to surfaceÂ **showstopper bugs**Â quickly. This allows developers to respond and fix them before the code reaches users or deeper testing layers.
    
* **Time and Resource Efficient**  
    SinceÂ **smoke testing is shallow**, it can be completed in minutes (especially when automated). This means developers and testers get fast feedback without spending time running fullÂ **test suites**.
    
* **Improves Software Stability**  
    Regular smoke testing ensures that theÂ **core application behavior**Â remains stable across builds. This is critical in agile environments withÂ **frequent code changes**Â and tight delivery deadlines.
    
* **Supports Continuous Integration (CI)**  
    Automated smoke tests can be integrated into CI tools likeÂ **Jenkins**,Â **GitHub Actions**, orÂ **GitLab CI/CD**. This allows each build to be validated automatically before being promoted to further environments.
    
* **Avoids Testing Broken Builds**  
    By validatingÂ **build health**Â at the very beginning, QA teams canÂ **skip deeper test cases**Â when the core system is already failing, resulting in improvedÂ **efficiency**.
    
* **Improves Confidence in Releases**  
    By consistently passing smoke tests, development teams gain more confidence inÂ **code quality**Â andÂ **deployment readiness**.
    

## Disadvantages of Smoke Testing

While useful, smoke testing has limitations that make it unsuitable as a standalone QA strategy:

* **Limited Scope**  
    Smoke testing does not go in-depth. It covers onlyÂ **major functionalities**, which meansÂ **edge cases**,Â **minor bugs**, or UI glitches may be missed entirely.
    
* **Potential to Miss Critical Bugs**  
    Because it avoids detailed scenarios,Â **smoke tests**Â may overlookÂ **small issues**Â that could becomeÂ **major bugs**Â in specific user workflows.
    
* **Over-Reliance Can Be Risky**  
    Treating smoke testing as a replacement forÂ **unit testing**,Â **functional testing**, orÂ **regression testing**Â is dangerous. It gives aÂ **false sense of security**Â about the health of the software.
    
* **Not a Comprehensive Testing Solution**  
    Smoke testing does not verifyÂ **business logic**,Â **UI consistency**, orÂ **performance**. It must be part of aÂ **multi-layered testing strategy**.
    

## **Best Practices for Effective Smoke Testing**

1. **Automate whenever possible :**
    
    * Automate your smoke tests to save time and increase accuracy, especially in CI/CD pipelines.
        
2. **Run Tests Early and Often:**
    
    * Perform smoke testing early in the development process and after every major code change to catch issues as soon as they arise.
        
3. **Keep Tests Simple:**
    
    * Focus on testing only the most critical functionalities. Smoke testing should be quick and not too detailed.
        
4. **Use the Right Tools:**
    
    * Choose tools that fit your projectâ€™s needs, such as Selenium for automated web application smoke tests or Jenkins for CI/CD pipelines.
        

**Involve the Entire Team:**

* Make smoke testing a collaborative effort by involving developers, testers, and stakeholders in the process.
    

## **Comparison of smoke testing with other testing types**
