Software testing can often seem like a difficult task. There are so many bugs to fix; deadlines are creeping up, and let’s be honest-sometimes testing just slows everything down.

***Does it resonate with you?***

Here’s the harsh reality “70% of software development teams say testing delays their releases, according to Capgemini. And for companies under pressure to launch faster, skipping proper testing might seem appealing. But we all know where that leads-frustrated users, negative reviews, and costly rework.  

What if there was a way to make testing easier, faster, and more collaborative? Here come low-code test automation frameworks. These tools help you create test cases without writing tricky codes. It helps teams save time and catch bugs earlier. 

Actually, low-code automation tools have been shown to reduce testing time by 40% as well as increase test coverage and reliability, according to Forrester. In this blog, we’ll look at the top 5 low-code test automation frameworks of 2025. Stay tuned-you might just find what you’ve been looking for.

## Why Use Low-Code Test Automation Tools?

Let’s start with a simple question: why is everyone talking about low-code automation tools in 2025?

It is because they are the perfect solution to growing problems. Manual testing and complex, code-heavy frameworks are slowing teams down. In an industry where speed and quality are everything, QA teams can’t afford to waste time writing and debugging endless scripts.

Low-code tools make testing easier by allowing anyone, even those without technical skills, to quickly create automated tests. They come with intuitive interfaces, pre-built components, and powerful integrations, allowing businesses to:

* **Reduce Time to Market:** Automate repetitive tests in minutes, not weeks.
    
* **Improve Collaboration:** Non-technical team members can participate in testing without needing coding knowledge.
    
* **Save Costs:** Eliminate the need for large, highly technical QA teams.
    
* **Enhance Accuracy:** Reduce the risk of human error in test creation and execution.
    

According to a recent report, companies that adopt a low-code test automation framework see a 45% reduction in testing time and a 30% increase in efficiency.
