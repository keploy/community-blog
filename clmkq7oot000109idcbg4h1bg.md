When we discuss software testing, we hear commonly about two things: - *"test scenarios"* and *"test cases"*. Now, these terms might sound similar to each other, but they play distinct roles in ensuring the quality of software applications. So, let's break it down in simpler terms as we explore the core differences between test scenarios and test cases.

## **What are Test Scenarios?**

Let's start with test scenarios. We can think of them as the architects of our testing plan, it provides a broad overview of what needs to be tested. It helps us answer questions like "What do we want to test?" and "Why are we testing it?"

### **Why we need to create Test Scenarios?**

Here's why test scenarios are important:

1. **Scope and Purpose**: Test scenarios act like a roadmap for your testing efforts. They define what you want to test and why you're testing it. They set the main goals and principles for your testing plan.
    
2. **User-Centric**: When creating test scenarios, think about how users interact with the software. What are the key things they do? Test scenarios should focus on these user actions. For example, if you're testing a shopping website, a scenario could be "A user buys a product."
    
3. **Important Functions**: Test scenarios often focus on the most crucial functions of the software. These are the scenarios that can make or break your application. They ensure that the essential features work as they should.
    
4. **Independent**: Test scenarios are usually separate from each other. This independence allows you to cover various functions without getting bogged down in the details.
    
5. **Not Too Detailed**: Unlike test cases, test scenarios don't dive into step-by-step instructions or specific data inputs. They provide a high-level description of what should happen without getting into specifics.
    

### **Some Best Practices for Creating Test Scenarios**

Both *test scenarios"* and *"test cases",* aim to make testing easier, enhance clarity and structure, and prioritize understanding customer requirements. Here are some tips for creating effective test scenarios:

* **Focus on the end-user**: Consider what actions the user will likely take while using the software. This forms the basis for every test scenario.
    
* **Associate one scenario with one requirement**: Keep it simple by dedicating each test scenario to a single user requirement.
    
* **Prioritize based on customer needs**: If you have many scenarios, prioritize them according to what's most important to the customer.
    

## **What are the Test Cases?**

Now, let's zoom in a bit and talk about test cases. If test scenarios are the architects, test cases are the detailed instructions for carrying out a specific test. Test cases break down the broader scenarios into specific actions and results you can check.

1. **Specific Actions**: Test cases specify the exact steps a tester should follow to perform a particular test. For example, if you're testing a login function, a test case might include steps like "Enter your username" and "Enter your password."
    
2. **Expected Outcomes**: Test cases define what should happen at each step. This lets you determine whether the software passed or failed the test. For our login example, the expected outcome might be "You successfully log in."
    
3. **Input Data**: Test cases often include specific information needed for testing, like the values to be entered or the conditions to be met. For a login test case, input data could be your username and password.
    
4. **Reproducible**: Test cases are designed to be repeatable. Anyone should get the same results by following the steps. This ensures consistency in testing.
    
5. **Cover Everything**: Test cases collectively cover all aspects of a test scenario, making sure you check all the details of the functionality you're testing.
    

### **Some Best Practices for Writing Test Cases**

Creating test cases involves carefully thinking about how to test the software, making sure it does what it's supposed to do, to guarantee the software application's functionality and performance. Using the best practices for generating test cases can help streamline the testing process effectively

* **Emphasize simplicity:** Ensure that the test cases are easy to understand and can be set up for execution quickly, without the need for testers to search for additional information.
    
* **Consider the end-user perspective:** Consider the end-user when drafting test cases. Understand their preferences, needs, and priorities, and design test steps accordingly to assess how well the software meets their requirements.
    
* **Follow naming conventions:** Use an established naming convention for test cases to maintain traceability per the requirements.
    
* **State assumptions and preconditions:** Clearly outline all assumptions and preconditions for each specific test to provide context and ensure accurate testing.
    
* **Cover each step of the user path:** Mention every step involved in the userâ€™s interaction with the feature being tested, guiding the tester through the entire process.
    
* **Aim for reusability:** Where possible, design test cases to be reusable by minimizing dependencies and conflicts that could make them interdependent rather than independent.
    
* **Prioritize test cases:** Rank test cases based on their priority, prioritizing critical features and scenarios and ensuring they are tested first.
    
* **Define expected results:** Clearly describe the expected outcomes of the test and how the software should appear after a particular feature has been triggered (post-conditions).
    
* **Run test cases across various environments:** Always execute your test cases in real browsers, devices, and platforms. Therefore, ensuring your software applications work seamlessly in various real environments.

## **The Relationship Between Test Scenarios and Test Cases**

Think of test scenarios as the overall plan and test cases as the specific actions you take to carry out that plan. Test scenarios guide your testing strategy, while test cases give you step-by-step instructions.

To make it clearer, imagine you're testing a social media platform. Your test scenario might be "A user creates a new post," giving you the general idea. Then, you create several test cases within this scenario, each focusing on a specific part, like "A user uploads an image," "A user adds text content," or "A user tags friends." These test cases together cover the complete scenario.

### **When to Use Test Scenarios and Test Cases**

Now, let's talk about when to use each of these testing components.

***Test Scenarios:*** You'll typically define test scenarios early in the testing process when you're planning your testing strategy. They help you set the direction and priorities for your testing efforts. Use them when you need an overview of what you're testing and why.

***Test Cases*:** Test cases come into play when you're doing the testing. You've already set your test scenarios, and now you need specific instructions for testers to follow. Use test cases when you want to check specific functions and need clear steps and expected outcomes.

### **A Real-Life Example**

Let's bring it all together with a real-life example: testing a weather forecasting app.

**Test Scenario:** "A user checks the current weather."

In this scenario, you want to make sure users can get accurate weather information. It's a big-picture goal.

**Test Cases:** Within this scenario, you create individual test cases for different parts of checking the weather:

* **Test Case 1:** "A user enters a valid city name."
    
    * Step 1: Open the app.
        
    * Step 2: Enter 'New York' as the city.
        
    * Expected Outcome: The app shows the current weather in New York.
        
* **Test Case 2:** "A user enters an invalid city name."
    
    * Step 1: Open the app.
        
    * Step 2: Enter 'Xyz123' as the city.
        
    * Expected Outcome: The app displays an error message, saying the city is not found.
        

Each test case breaks down the specific actions, input data, and expected outcomes, making sure the app's weather-checking function is thoroughly tested.
