## **TestNG vs JUnit: In-depth Key Differences**

Now that we understand the frameworks, let’s break down the details for a deeper insight and comparison of TestNG vs JUnit.

### **1\. Framework**

JUnit is a unit-testing framework in the Java ecosystem, primarily designed for unit testing. It's simple and flexible, making it ideal for developers focusing on testing individual components.

TestNG, on the other hand, is inspired by JUnit but extends its capabilities. It's suitable for all kinds of testing, including unit, functional, and [end-to-end testing](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1yM8z5xoOXd8F-GuFCh3ckbp2VD4SbQzh). TestNG's broader scope makes it a better choice for integrated testing scenarios.

### **2\. User Interface**

In terms of User Interface, both JUnit and TestNG do not have a dedicated UI for test execution or result visualization. They are typically used with IDEs like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA, which provide plugins or built-in support for these frameworks.

The difference lies in how results are presented in these IDEs, with TestNG offering more detailed and organized views, especially for larger test suites.

### **3\. Annotations**

Annotations in JUnit are straightforward and focused on basic testing needs. For example, **@Before**, **@After**, **@Test**, etc., are commonly used. TestNG, however, offers a wider range of annotations like **@BeforeSuite**, **@AfterSuite**, **@BeforeGroup**, and **@AfterGroup**.

That way TestNG provides more flexibility and control over test execution, especially in complex scenarios involving multiple test suites and groups.

### **4\. Writing Tests**

When it comes to Writing Tests, JUnit is generally simpler and more intuitive, especially for beginners or for basic unit tests. Its extended features make TestNG the best choice for advanced users, including those who need to handle dependency testing, parameterized testing, or group testing.

TestNG's flexibility allows for more sophisticated test case structures.

### **5\. Suite Test**

Suite Test execution in JUnit is limited compared to TestNG. JUnit allows the grouping of test cases, but it's not as extensive or flexible as TestNG.

The following class illustrates how to utilize the suite when applying JUnit4:

```java
package guru99.JUnit;

import org.JUnit.runner.RunWith;
import org.JUnit.runners.Suite;

@RunWith(Suite.class)
@Suite.SuiteClasses({
    SuiteTest1.class,
    SuiteTest2.class,
})

public class JUnitTest {
// This class remains empty,it is used only as a holder for the above annotations
}
```

TestNG excels in this area with its ability to create complex test suites using XML files, allowing for detailed organization and execution of tests.

```xml
<!DOCTYPE suite SYSTEM "http://beust.com/TestNG/TestNG-1.0.dtd" >

<suite name="My test suite">
<test name="testing">
<classes>
<class name="com.guru99.SuiteTest1" />

<class name="com.guru99.SuiteTest2" />
</classes>
</test>
</suite>
```

This feature is particularly useful in large projects with multiple modules and varied testing requirements.

### **6\. Test Setup**

JUnit provides a simple and straightforward approach to test setup with annotations like **@Before,** **@After**, **@BeforeClass**, and **@AfterClass**. These annotations help in executing specific code before and after each test or test class.

```java
public class SummationServiceTest {

    private static List<Integer> numbers;
    @BeforeAll
    public static void initialize() {
        numbers = new ArrayList<>();
    }
    @AfterAll
    public static void tearDown() {
        numbers = null;
    }
    @BeforeEach
    public void runBeforeEachTest() {
        numbers.add(1);
        numbers.add(2);
        numbers.add(3);
    }
    @AfterEach
    public void runAfterEachTest() {
        numbers.clear();
    }
    @Test
    public void givenNumbers_sumEquals_thenCorrect() {
        int sum = numbers.stream().reduce(0, Integer::sum);
        assertEquals(6, sum);
    }
}
```

TestNG extends this concept with additional annotations like **@BeforeSuite**, **@AfterSuite**, **@BeforeGroups**, and **@AfterGroups**, offering more granularity in test setup. They’re especially useful in complex scenarios involving multiple groups and suites.

```java
@BeforeGroups("positive_tests")
public void runBeforeEachGroup() {
    numbers.add(1);
    numbers.add(2);
    numbers.add(3);
}

@AfterGroups("negative_tests")
public void runAfterEachGroup() {
    numbers.clear(); 
}
```

For class-level operations, TestNG uses **@BeforeClass** and **@AfterClass** annotations. In contrast, method-level setup and cleanup are managed through **@BeforeMethod** and **@AfterMethod** annotations.

```java
@BeforeClass
public void initialize() {
    numbers = new ArrayList<>();
}

@AfterClass
public void tearDown() {
    numbers = null;
}

@BeforeMethod
public void runBeforeEachTest() {
    numbers.add(1);
    numbers.add(2);
    numbers.add(3);
}

@AfterMethod
public void runAfterEachTest() {
    numbers.clear();
}
```

Additionally, in TestNG, if you need to set up or clean up configurations before or after the test cases in the *&lt;test&gt;* tag of the TestNG XML file, you can use the **@BeforeTest** and **@AfterTest** annotations.

```xml
<test name="test setup">
    <classes>
        <class name="SummationServiceTest">
            <methods>
                <include name="givenNumbers_sumEquals_thenCorrect" />
            </methods>
        </class>
    </classes>
</test>
```

It's important to note that in JUnit, methods annotated with **@BeforeClass** and **@AfterClass** must be static. However, TestNG does not have this requirement for its methods.

### **7\. Ignore Test**

To Ignore Tests, JUnit uses the **@Ignore** annotation, which is straightforward and easy to use. Simply annotating a test method with **@Ignore** will prevent it from being executed.

```java
@Ignore

@Test

public void givenNumbers_sumEquals_thenCorrect() {

int sum = numbers.stream().reduce(0, Integer::sum);

Assert.assertEquals(6, sum);

}
```

TestNG, however, uses the enabled attribute within the **@Test** annotation **(@Test**(enabled = false)) to skip tests. This approach provides more flexibility, allowing the enable/disable status to be dynamically controlled.

```java
@Test(enabled=false)
public void givenNumbers_sumEquals_thenCorrect() {
    int sum = numbers.stream.reduce(0, Integer::sum);
    Assert.assertEquals(6, sum);
}
```

### **8\. Exception Test**

For Exception Testing, JUnit uses the *assertThrows* method in JUnit 5 or the expected attribute in the @**Test** annotation in JUnit 4. This allows specifying the expected exception for a test method.

TestNG handles this with the ***expectedExceptions*** attribute in the @**Test** annotation, which is similar in functionality, allowing tests to specify which exception they expect to be thrown.

```java
@Test
void testExpectedException() {
    Assertions.assertThrows(NumberFormatException.class, () -> {
        Integer.parseInt("Hello World"); //would fail since input is not a valid number
    });
}
```

### **9\. Timeout**

Timeouts in tests are supported by both frameworks. JUnit allows specifying a timeout duration with the timeout attribute in the **@Test** annotation or using *assertTimeout* in JUnit 5. TestNG also provides a timeout attribute in the **@Test** annotation.

This feature ensures that tests fail if they take longer than the specified duration, useful for detecting performance issues.

```java
@Test

public void givenExecution_takeMoreTime_thenFail() throws InterruptedException {

Assertions.assertTimeout(Duration.ofMillis(1000), () -> Thread.sleep(10000));

}
```

We can run the identical test in TestNG and JUnit 4 by using @Test(timeout=1000).

```java
@Test(timeOut = 1000)

public void givenExecution_takeMoreTime_thenFail() {

while (true);

}
```

### **10\. Dependency Tests**

Dependency Tests are a unique feature of TestNG, where tests can depend on the successful execution of other tests. Using the **dependsOnMethods** attribute in the **@Test** annotation, TestNG can skip subsequent tests if their dependencies fail, avoiding unnecessary execution.

```java
@Test

public void givenEmail_ifValid_thenTrue() {

boolean valid = email.contains("@");

Assert.assertEquals(valid, true);

}

@Test(dependsOnMethods = {"givenEmail_ifValid_thenTrue"})

public void givenValidEmail_whenLoggedIn_thenTrue() {

LOGGER.info("Email {} valid >> logging in", email);

}
```

JUnit does not natively support this feature, making TestNG more suitable for complex test scenarios where test execution order and dependency are critical.

### **11\. Grouping Tests**

JUnit does not inherently support grouping tests, which can limit its use in complex scenarios. However, it allows organizing tests into suites using annotations.

TestNG excels in this aspect, offering extensive support for grouping tests. This feature is particularly useful for categorizing tests based on functionality, modules, or other criteria, enhancing the manageability of large test suites.

### **12\. Parameterized Test**

Both frameworks support Parameterized Tests, but they approach it differently. JUnit4 uses the **@RunWith** and **@Parameters** annotations, providing a straightforward way to execute the same test with different data sets.

```java
@RunWith(value = Parameterized.class)

public class JUnitTest{

privateint number;

public JUnitTest6(int number)

{

this.number = number;

}

@Parameters

public static Collection<Object[]> data()

{

Object[][] data = new Object[][] { { 1 }, { 2 }, { 3 }, { 4 } };

returnArrays.asList(data);

}

@Test

public void parameterTest()

{

System.out.println("Parameterized Number is : " + number);

}

}

```

TestNG uses the **@DataProvider** annotation or XML files for parameterization, offering more flexibility in defining and managing test data.

```java
public class Test1 {

@Test

@Parameters(value="number")

public void parameterTest(int number)

{

System.out.println("Parameterized Number is : " + number);

}

}
```

See the XML file which contains the aforementioned class:

```xml
<!DOCTYPE suite SYSTEM "http://beust.com/TestNG/TestNG-1.0.dtd" >

<suite name="My test suite">

<test name="testing">

<parameter name="number" value="2"/>

<classes>

<class name="com.guru99.Test1" />

</classes>

</test>

</suite>
```

### **13\. Order of Test Execution**

JUnit generally executes tests in the order they are written or in an unpredictable order, depending on the version. It doesn't natively support specifying the execution order.

TestNG, however, allows defining the order of test execution using the priority attribute in the **@Test** annotation, giving more control over the test flow.

### **14\. Custom Test Name**

In JUnit, custom test names can be set using the **@DisplayName** annotation in JUnit 5, allowing for more descriptive test names.

TestNG allows customizing test names through the name attribute in the **@Test** annotation, which can make test reports more readable and manageable.

### **15\. Reporting**

TestNG is known for its superior reporting capabilities, providing detailed reports out of the box. These reports are more comprehensive and include various details about the test execution.

JUnit, while it does provide basic reporting, is generally less detailed compared to TestNG and often requires additional tools or libraries for enhanced reporting.

### **16\. Community & Support**

JUnit has a large and active community, partly due to its longer presence in the industry. It has extensive documentation and a vast number of resources available online. TestNG also has a strong community, though it may not be as large as JUnit's.

Both frameworks are well-supported with regular updates and community contributions.

## **The Best Alternative: The Other Side of the Coin**
