In the last ten years, software testing has advanced significantly, but today's applications require more than just using conventional forms of automated software testing or entry-level tools that employ artificial intelligence (AI). The rise of microservice architectures, API calls, and continuous deployment has led to another category of software testing products called "Generative" AI Testing tools.

Unlike previous generations of [software testing](https://keploy.io/blog/community/testing-methodologies-in-software-testing) products that provided assistance with various testing tasks, these **generative AI testing tools** actually generate test assets in addition to assisting with testing activities; thus, increasing the speed, effectiveness, and scalability of Quality Assurance processes.

## What Are Generative AI Testing Tools?

Testing Tools for Generative AI use the power of machine learning and large Language Models (LLMs) To Automatically create testing artefacts. In addition to using a pattern analysis approach by optimising material testing tools, generative AI testing tools leverage machine learning to produce completely new test cases, test data, as well as mock and stub objects based on actual application behaviour.

Unlike conventional [AI testing tools](https://keploy.io/blog/community/ai-testing-tools) that focus on future test predictions or optimisation of existing test cases (i.e., reviewing and updating), Generative AI creates:

* Test Cases based on Actual Traffic and/or Code Execution
    
* Mocks and Dependency Objects Created Automatically
    
* Tests Adapt to the Application Over Time
    

As such, there’s enormous potential for both Developers and QA Analysts to rapidly create a huge number of Updated Test Cases, Mocks and Dependency Objects so that they are always on top of changes made in real-time and can maintain high-quality consistency of the code across multiple releases.

## How Generative AI Testing Tools Differ from AI Testing Tools?

![Generative AI Testing Tools Differ from AI Testing Tools](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1764568979736/9e248baa-ed9b-4299-a449-da145d1bdf76.png align="center")

Testing tools for traditional AI test methods generally concentrate on enhancing the efficiency of the testing process (i.e., identifying flaky tests, priorititizing tests to be executed, and identifying visual changes). Whereas with the generative AI test method tools, you can take that a step further by generating new test logic automatically.

**In short**:

Traditional AI test tools improve efficiency by optimizing the testing process.

Generative AI test tools enable the automation of the creation of tests.

The use of generative AI test method tools greatly alleviates the need for human effort involved in writing and maintaining tests.

## Core Capabilities of Generative AI Testing Tools

With some of the latest AI technology available to you through Generative AI test tools, you will experience many advantages not available with traditional tools.

1. ### **Automated Test Case Generation**
    

Generative AI tools are able to create great test cases without the need for test scripts by analysing [API calls](https://keploy.io/blog/community/monitor-api-calls-chrome-validate-flask-apis) data, logs from an application or user interactions.

2. ### **Smart Mock and Stubbing**
    

Mocking dependencies of an application like third-party APIs or microservices are now automatically created which allows for greater reliability and decreases test flakiness.

3. ### **Natural Language Based Testing**
    

Some of the new Generative AI tools allow you to write your scenarios in plain English and convert them into executable [test cases](https://keploy.io/blog/community/a-guide-to-test-cases-in-software-testing#a-functional-test-cases).

4. ### **Continuous Adaptation**
    

Tests will evolve automatically as your application changes, which will reduce your overhead associated with maintenance.

## How Generative AI Testing Tools Work?

![Generative AI Testing Tools Work](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1764569293112/fcb511c7-67b7-4354-87a4-5682a6c57ae2.png align="center")

A simple yet powerful approach to the development process involves:

1. Collecting application-related information from actual applications, including API Traffic, Execution Traces, and Logs, etc.
    
2. Generating behavior of the application is based on this collected information through a generative model.
    
3. The Generative Model will automatically [generate Test Cases](https://keploy.io/test-case-generator), Mocks, and Data Sets for the application.
    
4. Generated Test Cases are validated during execution and may be integrated into the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline(s).
    
5. As part of the process, feedback from the execution of test cases can improve future test generation.
    

This feedback loop allows for the continuous improvement of the tests alongside the ongoing development of the application.
