I was reading about the gRPC recently and was wondering what all this about? Believe me, I was in the same boat not too long ago. I didn't even know what exactly gRPC means before this.

If you're curious about how to inspect gRPC traffic, check out this guide on [capturing gRPC traffic going out from a server](https://keploy.io/blog/technology/capture-grpc-traffic-going-out-from-a-server).

In this blog, I will walk you through everything I have learned about the game changing technology that is changing the world of distributed system.

## **What is gRPC?**

![what-is-grpc](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1751456082432/b49a478a-1350-49a7-b4c8-96d27a0eafba.png align="center")

Imagine this, You are building a microservices architecture, and you want your services to talk to each other efficiently. In this case, traditional APIs work, but what If I told you that there is something faster and more secure and developer friendly? That\`s **gRPC**!

gRPC which is know as Google Remote Procedure Call is a high performance, open source framework which allows application to communicate with each other as they are a local function. It is like having a magic route between the services that speaks multiple language fluently.

You know, the beauty of gRPC lies in its simplicity from a developerâ€™s point of view. Because Instead of just crafting HTTP request, you can call methods which feels like a local object. But under the table, it does some seriously impressive work to make that happen fluently.

## **Key Components of gRPC**

Let me explain to you about the component of gRPC in detail:

1. **Protocol Buffers(Protobuf):** This is like a secret sauce. You can think of it as a super efficient way to define your data structures and service contracts. Basically, It is like having a universal translator that every programming language understands.
    
2. **gRPC Runtime**: Well, This is all about handling the heavy lifting - serialization, network communication, error handling and many more. In this, you define your services and the runtime takes care of making it work across the network.
    
3. **Code Generation**: Here is thing where this is cool. From the protocol buffer definition, gRPC generates the client and server code in you language of choice. So, there is no more writing boilerplate of HTTP clients! Yes, you heard it right.
    
4. **Channel Management**: It manages connection intelligently by handling things like load balancing, retries and timeouts automatically.
    

## **Implementing gRPC: Best Practices**

![grpc-best-practices](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1751453268168/76acbc96-ac20-40ff-9d3b-f85c0fc541f6.png align="center")

After reading and working with gRPC for a while now, I have picked some best practices that will actually save you from the headache and from wasting your time.

* Okay, start with your `.proto` files and get them correct. These are basically your contracts and changing them later can be little tricky. Track the version of your services from day one, even if you think that you don\`t need it. You have to trust me on this one.
    
* Use proper error handling. gRPC has a rich error model which means do not just throw a generic error. Your teammates will thank you!
    
* Implement proper logging and monitoring. gRPC calls can fail in different ways and you want to know what is happening. So, Interceptor is your best friend in this.
    
* Lastly, choose your deployment strategy early. Look, gRPC works great in Kubernetes but it if you are dealing with browser clients, you will need gRPC web or a proxy for it.
    

## **What Makes gRPC So Popular?**

You know what is more interesting about the gRPC? Let me tell you. gRPC has gone from being Google\`s internal tool to becoming one of the most adopted technologies in the cloud native environment, and there is a reason for it.

## **gRPC is a CNCF Incubation Project**

![grpc-is-a-cncf-project](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1751454441719/45e07f71-0cb9-48ef-af65-438ef15a703a.png align="center")

Yes, you read correctly! The Cloud Native Computing Foundation doesn\`t just accept any project. That means this is actually a big deal. gRPC is an incubation project means it has proven itself in the production environment, has a healthy ecosystem and is currently being maintained by an active community.

It is not just a Google pet project anymore; It has become a cornerstone of the modern cloud native architecture.

## Why gRPC Has Taken Off

### 1\. Performance

In this, let\`s talk about numbers because we mostly believe in numbers. gRPC is fast compared to traditional REST APIs. I have seen performance improvements of 5 to 10 times in real-world applications. The combination of HTTP/2, binary seralization and efficient compression makes a huge difference, especially when you are dealing with large payloads.

### **2\. Language Support**

This is the place where gRPC actually outperformed others. You can have a python service talking to a Java service, which calls a Go service and all seamlessly. The generated code feels native in each language.

I have worked with the team where we had microservices in different languages and trust me gRPC made it feel like we are working with a monolith in terms of type safety and ease of integration.

### **3\. Streaming**

Real time feature gives pain to implement it. With gRPC streaming, you can build real time dashboards, chat application or live data feed with the little code. The streaming support is bidirectional too that means you can have clients and servers both sending data as needed.

### **4\. Interoperability**

You know, the cross platform nature of gRPC is incredible. Mobile apps can talk to backend services using the same efficient protocol. Any IOT device can communicate with the cloud services. In this, web app can maintain same contracts as server to server communication.

## gRPC Architecture

Here is one of the most important topic to understand. Like how gRPC works and how the architecture look like.

![grpc-architecutre](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1751454915065/92b824d1-18f1-48d5-a7e9-1c120ec0fb45.png align="center")

The architecture is pretty simple. You have a gRPC server that implement your service interface and clients that call method on that service such that they were local functions. The gRPC runtimes handles serialization, network transport and deserialication transparently.

What interesting is how it uses HTTP/2 as the transport layer. This gives you all the benefits of HTTP/2 (multiplexing, flow control, header compression) while maintaining the simplicity of procedure calls. The client and server don't need to know about HTTP at all - they just see method calls and responses.

## **Why is gRPC So Fast?**

### 1\. HTTP/2 -

Look, this is huge. While REST APIs are typically stuck with the [HTTP](https://keploy.io/blog/community/understanding-http-and-https-as-a-beginner-2)/1.1\`s request and response limitations, but gRPC leverages HTTP/2 multiplexing. Multiple request can be on a same boat simultaneously over a single connection. No more connection pooling headaches or head of line blocking.

### 2\. Binary serialisation

JSON is my best friend and I know yours too which is great for us but not for machines. In this what happens, protocol buffers create much smaller payloads and I have seen 60 to 80 % size reduction compared to equivalent JSON. Smaller payloads means faster network transmission and less bandwidth usage, right!

### 3\. Compression

As we know, gRPC compress data automatically. By combining with the compact binary format, you are looking at the best efficient data transfer. This is especially notable In mobile applications or when we are dealing with limited bandwidth.

### 4\. Streaming

Instead of multiple round trips, we can stream data continuously. Consider scenarios like real time analytics or live updates, this eliminates the latency of establishing new connections repeatedly.

## **Features of gRPC**

The feature are pretty cool. You get authentication and encryption out of the box. Load balancing is the built in feature. Automatic retries and timeout helps with the resilience. Health checking is standardised.

But what I love most about gRPC is the developer experience. IntelliSense works perfectly because everything is strongly typed. API documentation is generated from the .proto files automatically, and refactoring across service boundaries becomes safe.

## **Working with Protocol Buffers**

You might be thinking, what are protocol buffers? Right. So, Protocol Buffers is the heart of gRPC. You can think of this as a more efficient, strongly typed JSON. In this, you define the data structure in `.proto` files using a simple syntax and the compiler generates code for the language you want.

But syntax is intuitive. You define messages like structs and services like interfaces. Field numbering is important for backward compatibility and there are rules about how to evolve your schemas safely.

Let me show you how this actually works. Here is a simple .proto file that defines a user service.

```json
syntax = "proto3";

package user;

service UserService {
  rpc GetUser(GetUserRequest) returns (User);
  rpc CreateUser(CreateUserRequest) returns (User);
  rpc ListUsers(ListUsersRequest) returns (ListUsersResponse);
}

message User {
  int32 id = 1;
  string name = 2;
  string email = 3;
  int64 created_at = 4;
}

message GetUserRequest {
  int32 id = 1;
}

message CreateUserRequest {
  string name = 1;
  string email = 2;
}

message ListUsersRequest {
  int32 page_size = 1;
  string page_token = 2;
}

message ListUsersResponse {
  repeated User users = 1;
  string next_page_token = 2;
}
```

From this single .proto file, you can generate client and server code in multiple languages.

Here is how the implementation will look in Golang:

```go
func (s *server) GetUser(ctx context.Context, req *pb.GetUserRequest) (*pb.User, error) {
    // Your business logic here
    user := &pb.User{
        Id:        req.Id,
        Name:      "John Doe",
        Email:     "john@example.com",
        CreatedAt: time.Now().Unix(),
    }
    return user, nil
}
```

## **Protocol Buffer Versions**

In protocol buffers, there are two main versions: Proto2 and Proto3.

Proto3 is simpler and more widely supported. unless you have some specific requirements that need proto2 features then go with proto3. The syntax is cleaner and it is what most of the new projects are using currently.

## **gRPC Method Types**

gRPC supports four types of method types calls:

1. **Unary RPc:** This is a traditional request response which is like REST APIs but faster.
    
2. **Server Streaming:** In this, client sends one request, server sends back a stream of responses. It is great for downloading large datasets or real time updates.
    
3. **Client Streaming:** Client sends a stream of requests and server responds back with a single response. It is perfect for uploading data and aggregating information.
    
4. **Bidirectional Streaming**: In bidirectional streaming, both sides can send streams independently. This is where things get really interesting for real time applications.
    

## **gRPC vs. REST**

This is the question everyone asks, right? REST is not going anywhere, but gRPC has some great advantages.  
gRPC is faster, efficient and it provides more better tooling. The type safety alone is worth considering and is great to compare. API evolution is more structured by using protocol buffers.

As we know, REST has broader ecosystem support, everyone is using REST, especially for public APIs. It is easier to debug with the standard HTTP tools. Browser support is more straightforward here.

Let me show you the difference in a real scenario by getting a user by ID:

**REST Approach**

```javascript
// Client code
const response = await fetch('/api/users/123', {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + token
  }
});
const user = await response.json();

// You need to manually handle:
// - HTTP status codes
// - JSON parsing errors  
// - Type checking (user.name could be undefined)
// - Error response formats
```

**gRPC Approach**

```javascript
// Client code (with gRPC-Web)
const request = new GetUserRequest();
request.setId(123);

client.getUser(request, {}, (err, response) => {
  if (err) {
    // Structured error handling
    console.log('Error:', err.message);
  } else {
    // Type-safe response
    console.log('User:', response.getName());
  }
});

// You get:
// - Automatic serialization/deserialization
// - Type safety (response.getName() is guaranteed to exist)
// - Structured error handling
// - Better performance
```

The difference is night and day here. With REST, you're dealing with strings, manual parsing, and hoping the API contract hasn't changed. But with gRPC, everything is typed, validated, and the contract is enforced at compile time.

So, my opinion on this comparison will be that you can use gRPC for the service-to-service communication, especially in microservice architectures and consider REST APIs for the public APIs or when you need maximum compatibility.

## **What is gRPC used for?**

Look, the use cases for this are pretty diverse. That means microservices communication is the obvious one, but I have read articles in which gRPC is used for mobile app backends, IoT device communications, real-time features and even as a replacement for message queues in some places.

Currently, big tech companies use this. Netflix uses it for their natural services. Dropbox also built its entire storage system on gRPC. Even traditional enterprises are adopting it for modernizing their architectures.

## **Integration Testing With Keploy**

Now, here is something really exciting that I found recently. You know how testing gRPC can be a real pain, right? Well, there's this tool called Keploy that's making it pretty easy.

![integration-testing-with-keploy](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1751478808411/85cb7ecf-cb79-4eee-bb5a-d36894b4f0e8.png align="center")

[Keploy](https://keploy.io/) provide the support for gRPC integration testing and it is definitely a great for testing gRPC services.

It watches your gRPC calls while your app is running and automatically creates test cases from real interactions. I'm not kidding, you just use your application normally, and it records everything. Then later, it can replay those exact same interactions as tests. You can read about [integration testing with keploy](https://keploy.io/docs/concepts/reference/glossary/integration-testing/) here.

**The dependency thing is genius**: Remember how we always struggle with mocking databases and external services in our tests? Keploy captures all of that too. So when it replays your tests, it uses the exact same data that was returned during the recording. So basically, it doesn't spend more hours setting up test databases or writing complex mocks.

**Catching regressions**: You know, this is where it outperformed others. When you make changes to your gRPC services, Keploy compares the new responses with what it recorded before. If something changes unexpectedly, it flags it immediately.

Keploy represents the future of API testing that is intelligent, automated, and incredibly developer friendly. So, If you're building gRPC services, definitely check out what Keploy can do for your testing workflow. It's one of those tools that makes you wonder how you ever tested APIs without it.

## Benefits of gRPC

The benefits are quite interesting:

* Performance improvements are real and measurable.
    
* Development velocity increases because of the strong typing and code generation.
    
* Cross language interoperability becomes trivial.
    
* Operational complexity decreases because of standardized health checks, metrics and tracing
    

The ecosystem of gRPC is rich, too. There are interceptors for logging, authentication, and monitoring. In this, cloud providers also offer native support.

## **Challenges of gRPC**

Let\`s be honest about the downsides. This is the point everyone looks right. In the gRPC, browser support requires gRPC web, which adds complexity. The learning curve can be steep if your team is used to REST. And also debugging can be more trickier since you cant just use curl.

The binary format makes manual testing more difficult. We need tools like grpcurl or GUI clients. Protocol buffers schema evolution also needs to plan carefully.

Load balancers and proxies need to understand gRPC, which might requires infrastructure changes. Some organization find the operational overhead initially challenging.

## **Conclusion**

Look, gRPC is not a silver bullet, but it is a powerful tool that can improve your distributed systems. The performance gains alone make it worth considering but the main thing is its developer experience which make the teams stick to it.

So, if you are building new services or modernizing existing services, you can definitely give gRPC a look. I recommend you to start small, maybe with one or two service pair, and see how it feels. I guarantee you will be surprised at how much it can simplify your architecture while managing everything faster.

And the important thing is Cloud Native world is moving towards gRPC for good reasons. It is worth understanding even if you donâ€™t want to use it now. And who knows? It might be become your favourite way to build distributed systems.

## **Frequently Asked Question(FAQ)**

**Q1. Can I use gRPC with web browsers directly?**

Not directly, but gRPC-Web solves this. You will need a proxy like Envoy, but it works great and gives you most gRPC benefits in the browser.

**Q2. How do I handle versioning when my API changes?**

You can basically follow Protocol Buffer compatibility rules and add fields safely, never change field numbers. Start with versioned service names like `UserServiceV1` from day one.

**Q3. Is gRPC overkill for simple CRUD applications?**

Maybe. For basic web apps with simple CRUD, REST is fine. gRPC shines with complex service interactions, high performance needs, or microservices architectures.

**Q4. How does gRPC handle authentication and security?**

gRPC handle authentication and security using built-in TLS/SSL encryption. Also use interceptors for auth logic with JWT, OAuth, or client certificates. Cloud providers offer seamless integration.

**Q5. What happens if my gRPC service is down?**

So, you can try built-in retry logic, timeouts, and status codes help handle failures and Implement health checks and monitoring and also design for failure from the start.
