Selenium has long been the standard for web automation testing, but modern web development demands more flexible, efficient, and developer-friendly solutions. 

We are Node.js developers and we all know what a Node.js developer wants. 

**So, you don’t know what a Node.js Developer wants?**

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfWcTZDjsLRiAITTGr5U0nZshEEq6vXZbv7Y9cCMynjkPPub79mvfRTeRVzo1Pjgzd_D2n0s9MoNH5UoRd9lqDtZRJTWvGjPxTYlIjFogQyEYut05y83G3WQEWNjllLzwxjlsGN4w?key=udg3fjk0o3bqGsCOe-D3MWyv align="left")

Cypress is a next generation front end testing tool built for the modern web. Install it in your project by - 

`npm install cypress`

### **Best things about Cypress:**

* **Real-time reloading**: Automatically reloads tests upon code changes, speeding up development.
    
* **Time-travel debugging**: Allows inspecting previous states and commands in the Cypress Test Runner.
    
* **Automatic waiting**: Handles waits for DOM elements, ensuring reliable test execution.
    
* **Built-in screenshot and video recording**: Captures media during test runs for debugging.
    
* **Easy mocking and stubbing**: Provides powerful utilities for network request interception and response mocking.
    

## 4.TestCafe

![TestCafe | Keploy blog](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1735796800140/e215d9fa-c001-4f4b-a871-847e57c40258.png align="center")

TestCafe is also an end-to-end testing solution. Install it in your project by - 

`npm install testcafe`

### **Best things about TestCafe:**

* **No WebDriver required**: Eliminates dependency on Selenium or WebDriver for browser interactions.
    
* **Cross-browser testing**: Supports major browsers, including mobile emulation.
    
* **Automatic waiting mechanism**: Waits for page loads, animations, and other DOM activities automatically.
    
* **Easy selectors**: Provides an intuitive API to locate and interact with elements on the page.

## **FAQs**

### **Can I use Playwright for API testing?**

Yes, Playwright supports API testing by allowing you to send HTTP requests and validate responses directly in your test scripts. This enables you to test both UI and API in the same framework, offering end-to-end testing capabilities.

### **How does Cypress handle API testing?**

Cypress provides built-in support for API testing through its `cy.request()` command, which allows you to interact with APIs, validate responses, and stub network requests. This integration makes it convenient to test API endpoints alongside your frontend.

### **Why is Keploy a better alternative for API testing than Playwright and Cypress?**

Keploy specializes in API testing with features like automatic test generation, schema validation, and mock server creation. It eliminates the need for manual test writing, and ensuring faster test coverage. Additionally, Keploy focuses on capturing real-time traffic, enabling realistic and efficient testing for APIs, making it more suited for API-specific scenarios compared to general-purpose frameworks like Playwright and Cypress.
