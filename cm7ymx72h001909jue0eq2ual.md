## The Importance of Web Accessibility: A Real-World Scenario

You just got home after a hard day at work and you are too tired to cook, so you decide to visit a restaurant's website to check the menu. But as you try to , the text is hard to read, buttons are unresponsive, and the images don't have descriptions. Frustrating, right? This is the reality many users face when websites aren't accessible. In fact, 70% of disabled shoppers leave inaccessible websites (Click-Away Pound).

In other words, inaccessible websites cause companies to lose their users. While accessibility testing tools can help detect some issues, they can't catch everything. In this article, you’ll learn best practices to consider when using accessibility tools to test the code of your project’s website.

## Why Manual Testing is Essential for Accurate Accessibility Evaluation?

When it comes to testing your project’s code for accessibility, it’s always best to remember that two heads are better than one. While tools like Accessibility Insights or WAVE’s Chrome Extension are powerful, sometimes these results might not offer the best solution. For example, I was working on making the background and foreground colors of DocsGPT’s website more accessible. Initially, I went with the test results’ suggestion to use the hex code `#727272` (gray) for the foreground but something inside me told me to choose a different color.

So I asked the project’s maintainer for some suggestions and they recommended that I go with the hex code `#595959` (a lighter gray) because it causes users to focus more on the tool and complies with the WCAG guidelines for color contrast. Now, [manual testing is not the only way](https://keploy.io/blog/community/why-manual-testing-matters-a-ultimate-guide-to-software-testing) to use accessibility testing tools effectively. Let’s look at another one.

## How to Gather Valuable Feedback for Accessibility Improvements?

Even though accessibility testing tools quickly provide insight on how a website can be more accessible, it's always best to involve users with disabilities or people who are accessibility experts. After conducting an accessibility test on Pingcap’s [documentation site with the WAVE](https://keploy.io/blog/community/dignify-your-test-automation-with-concise-code-documentation) Chrome Extension, it revealed that the icons were missing alt text. So, I added alt text to the icons and asked one of the maintainers who is knowledgeable in web accessibility for feedback.

They used a screen reader on the deployed version of my contribution and found the changes to be effective. Now, gathering feedback is not the only way to use accessibility tools effectively. Let’s look at another one.

## Prioritizing Accessibility Issues: Focus on High-Impact Fixes

Remember the saying, ***‘Not all things are created equal’?*** The same applies to web accessibility. When using accessibility tools to test code, these tools often identify numerous issues, so it’s crucial for developers to prioritize the most critical ones to ensure meaningful improvements for all users.

> For example, a colleague of mine raised a couple of accessibility issues for LinksHub’s website using IBM’s browser extension. After debating on which issues needed more attention, I decided to work on improving the site’s social media icons because I was concerned that screen reader users would have a harder time navigating the website. From there, my colleague worked on adding `<aria-label>` tags to the links and buttons.

As a result, more screen reader users had an easier time navigating the website. Now before you leave and start tinkering with accessibility tools, there’s just one more best practice to consider.

## Using Multiple Accessibility Testing Tools: A Smarter Approach

When it comes to using accessibility testing tools, it’s always best to use more than one. They can help give you more ideas on how to make your code more accessible. I was trying to test Leonardo Montini’s open-source project (a really awesome site where you can post your open source contributions to your resume/CV) for its accessibility. First, I found that the website received a score of 2.93:1 on WEB AIM’s color contrast checker. Then I did a test using the WAVE Chrome extension and found that the form elements were missing `<label>` tags.

So, I changed the primary color's hex code from `#3b82f6` (dodger blue) to `#2d63bc` (blue streak) and then added the `<label>` tag to the website’s dropdown button.

## Best Accessibility Testing Tools to Improve Your Website

Here are some useful accessibility testing tools that can help improve your website:

* **WAVE Chrome Extension** – Helps detect contrast issues, missing alt text, and ARIA errors.
    
* **Keploy** – While traditionally used for API testing, [Keploy](https://keploy.io) can be integrated with accessibility testing workflows to ensure web applications are functional and inclusive.
    
* **Accessibility Insights** – Provides automated and guided accessibility testing.
    
* **IBM Accessibility Checker** – Identifies accessibility issues within web pages.
    
* **WebAIM Contrast Checker** – Assesses color contrast compliance with WCAG.
    

## Conclusion

By combining the power of accessibility testing tools with manual testing methods, real user feedback, and a focus on prioritizing critical issues, you can create digital experiences that all users can enjoy. Whether you're developing a personal project or working on a company website, accessibility should be a key priority. Start testing today and make the web a better place for everyone.

## FAQs

### 1\. What is accessibility testing?

Accessibility testing ensures that digital products (websites, apps, etc.) are usable by people with disabilities, including those who rely on screen readers or keyboard navigation.

### 2\. Can automated tools replace manual accessibility testing?

No. Automated tools are great for detecting common issues, but manual testing with real users ensures a more inclusive user experience.

### 3\. How often should accessibility testing be performed?

Regularly! Ideally, accessibility should be tested throughout the development lifecycle to prevent issues from accumulating.

### 4\. How does Keploy fit into accessibility testing?

While Keploy specializes in API testing, it can be used alongside accessibility tools to ensure that APIs serving accessible content are functioning correctly and efficiently.
