**Key Features of Replit:**

* Instant Coding Without Setup or Download
    
* Web-Based Interface Accessible On Any Device
    
* Team Collaboration in Real Time
    
* Web App Deployment Made Easy
    

### **What is Cursor?**

![Cursor](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1765977455365/5e085f62-6546-46c6-bf80-e086f518b76e.png align="center")

Cursor is a local development environment built with strong artificial intelligence integration, making it perfect for developers developing larger and more complex projects or code bases. Rather than being a web (cloud-based) application (like Replit), Cursor is an extension integrated into existing Integrated Development Environments (IDE) such as Visual Studio Code (VS Code). The most important function of Cursor is providing high accuracy, contextualised AI support for coding activities (e.g., providing guidance for developers when refactoring code) and to optimise their workflow. In addition, the highly experienced developer will use Cursor as an assistant in a more complex and larger-scale development environment.

**Key Features of Cursor:**

* Refactoring with AI and code completion assistance
    
* Within-current-IDE functionality supporting existing IDEs like VS Code
    
* Version control capability through integration with Git
    
* Providing contextualised recommendations according to project structure
    

## **Core Differences: Replit vs Cursor**

### **1\. Setting** **up** **an** **Environment**

* Replit provides easy access for developers to begin coding without having to worry about how to create their coding environment since it runs in the web browser. Developers can log onto Replit's website, start coding immediately, and do not have to manually install their entire development environment or configure application settings or dependency requirements on their computers or local machines.
    
* Cursor, however, requires developers to build their own local dev environment. Cursor works directly with the developer's preferred code editor, which is usually Microsoft Visual Studio Code. While this approach means that a developer must invest more time in setting up their environment, it allows the developer to fully control how they set up their dev experience.
    

### **2.** Capabilities **of** **AI**

* Replit's AI features have been designed to assist beginners in getting started with coding; as such they provide assistance when creating code through auto-completions, error detection and repair, as well as easy-to-follow explanations of basic errors that may occur when beginning to learn to code. Although these capabilities can be beneficial for a beginner who is just starting to practice with programming, they may not have the same level of effectiveness for assisting with advanced coding tasks due to their simplicity when contrasted with Cursor.
    
* The AI capabilities available through Cursor are much more advanced than those available via Replit’s AI. For example, Cursor's AI uses the developer’s entire project(s) when suggesting smarter code completions, giving deep refactoring suggestions, including suggestions based on the developer's workflow, and even creating bridges between multiple files for the developer to make multiple changes at once. Cursor’s AI capabilities are suitable for developers building and managing much larger applications than the majority of beginner developers will be managing.
    

### **3\. Collaboration**

* Replit's real-time collaborative feature is probably Replit's most useful feature. It allows multiple users to work on the same project simultaneously and is ideal for both educational and hackathon usage. The cloud-based solution of Replit eliminates any potential difficulties companies face in sharing and collaborating through version control options.
    
* Cursor does not have a built-in real-time collaboration tool, but it easily integrates with Git for teams that are already using version control. Cursor is therefore better suited to teams building large applications that require advanced methods of collaborating, such as code reviews, merging, and branching.
    

### **4\. Deployment & Lifecycle Management**

* Replit allows users to deploy applications directly from the IDE, which significantly reduces the time and effort spent on deployment for developers. Especially for simple prototypes and small projects, the ease of deploying directly from Replit creates fewer hassles for the developer since they can quickly see the results of their code.
    
* With Cursor, developers must manually deploy their applications, which gives them more flexibility in managing code, but makes it more suitable for applications in production where optimization and scalability need to be a priority.
    

## **Pros & Cons: Replit vs Cursor**

### Benefits of using Replit:

* The quick setup time makes it easier for new developers or those who want to quickly build a prototype.
    
* Real-time collaboration allows developers to work together as a team, and is an effective learning environment.
    
* Quick and easy deployment methods mean that users can publish their projects without having to worry about deployment issues.
    

### Downside of using Replit:

* Advanced features are not available in Replit's cloud environment(SOE), so some users may find that they don't have enough flexibility with larger, more complex applications.
    
* The AI features were specifically designed for beginners, therefore experienced developers may not find them as beneficial.
    

### Benefits of using Cursor:

* Cursor provides developers with advanced AI support and provides contextual assistance in refactoring large codebases or completing difficult programming tasks.
    
* Cursor allows developers to customize their workflow based on their specific requirements through the use of VS Code.
    
* Cursor seamlessly integrates with Git so that teams who rely on version control and need advanced collaboration features will benefit from this integration.
    

### Downside of using Cursor:

* The steeper learning curve; because Cursor is a more advanced tool than others, it can be intimidating for the beginner. It can take time to set up your environment and learn the more advanced features.
    
* The manual deployment; Cursor’s manual way of deploying differs from Replit’s automated process and requires a more manual approach which may not be ideal for building a quick prototype.

While Tools such as Replit or Cursor enable developers to rapidly write AI-generated code, a modern developer must also rely on confidence that their new code will not break anything from previous versions of the application being developed. This is where an AI-based Testing Tool, such as Keploy, can be integrated into the developer's workflow seamlessly.

Keploy is an [AI-powered testing platform](http://keploy.io) that automatically generates test cases by observing real API traffic. Instead of manually writing tests, developers can capture real requests and responses and turn them into reusable tests that run in CI/CD pipelines.

### Using Keploy with Replit

Users of Replit can use Keploy for both educational purposes and the development of smaller applications. With Replit, Keploy can automatically generate a suite of tests for each of the API calls that were recorded while learning from the experience of actual developers. By doing this, Replit promotes testing to new developers, and it also gives those new developers a streamlined way to develop an API application.

### Using Keploy with Cursor

Keploy is especially useful when integrating with Cursor since teams that utilize Cursor for large code bases may utilize AI to assist in refactoring and/or changing previously created code. Keploy allows teams to validate every refactor by replaying live API traffic thus providing confidence to ship quickly without causing regressions in the production environment.

### The reasoning behind this methodology is as follows:

* **Cursor + Keploy**: Enhanced AI-script Coding Automated Regression Testing On Large-Scale Systems With Keploy
    
* **Replit + Keploy**: Development With No Effort Testing For Learning & Prototyping
    
* **DevOps-ready**: Keploy integrates easily into [CI/CD pipelines](https://keploy.io/blog/community/how-cicd-is-changing-the-future-of-software-development), complementing both tools in modern delivery workflows
    

By combining either Replit or Cursor and Keploy to perform Test Automation, it enables Integrated Engineering Process for acquiring efficient coding, automated test completion and assurance of product shipping confidence.
