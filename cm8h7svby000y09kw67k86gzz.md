## **How to Install and Set Up Flutter in IntelliJ IDEA on Windows**

Google developed Flutter as a well-known user interface toolkit that enables developers to create native applications that operate on mobile and multiple platforms using a solitary codebase. 

The integration of Flutter and Dart by IntelliJ IDEA delivers first-class support for development applications, so it works perfectly for Flutter projects. 

The upcoming guide demonstrates the comprehensive process to install and configure Flutter inside the IntelliJ IDEA development environment on a Windows platform.

**Step 1:** Install Flutter

The first requirement for starting Flutter in IntelliJ IDEA consists of Flutter installation on your Windows system.

**1\. Download Flutter**

* You should visit the official Flutter website located at [https://flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev).
    
* Follow the interface procedure by clicking on Get Started.
    
* Select Windows from the list of operating systems.
    
* Obtain the newest version of Flutter SDK (Windows) through the zip file download.
    

**2\. Extract Flutter SDK**

* The ZIP file downloaded from the internet should be found within the "Download" folder.
    
* Select Extract All through the file's right-click menu or use WinRAR together with the 7-Zip utility for extraction.
    
* Flutter should be extracted to the C:\\flutter directory, but it can also be placed in any other PC folder.
    

**3\. Add Flutter to System Path**

The system path requires Flutter to be added so users can execute Flutter commands from any position within the Command Prompt (CMD).

* Launch File Explorer, then navigate to C:\\flutter\\bin but use the actual Flutter installation directory if you did not place it there.
    
* Copy the path (e.g., C:\\flutter\\bin).
    
* Access the Windows search bar to look for environment variables before launching the editing interface for system environment variables.
    
* Open File Explorer to navigate to Environment Variables, then find and select Path under "System Variables," after which click Edit.
    
* After opening the dialog box, select New, then paste the path, which is C:\\flutter\\bin.
    
* Press OK to implement and terminate the open windows.
    

### **4\. Verify Flutter Installation**

* Open **Command Prompt (CMD)** and type:  
    flutter doctor
    
* Press Enter. The command helps detect missing dependencies in the system. The output will supply instructions to remedy unfulfilled requirements if any conditions are not satisfied.
    

**Step 2:** Install IntelliJ IDEA

**Step 3:** The user needs to install both Flutter and Dart plugins in IntelliJ IDEA.

**1\. Open IntelliJ IDEA**

* Open IntelliJ IDEA by accessing it through the desktop or the Start menu.
    
* Open the Plugins feature by using the Welcome screen navigation or by selecting the option File → Settings → Plugins.
    

**2\. Install the Flutter Plugin**

* Search for Flutter inside the Plugins window through the provided search field.
    
* Click on the Install button from the Flutter plugin.
    
* The IDE presents a recommendation to install the Dart plugin because it serves as a necessary component for operating with Flutter. Click Install.
    
* A restart of IntelliJ IDEA will enforce the applied modifications.
    

**Step 4:** Establish Flutter functionality within IntelliJ IDEA.

**1\. Create a New Flutter Project**

* In the first step, users need to open up IntelliJ IDEA and then select New Project.
    
* Select Flutter from the list.
    
* Users who encounter issues with automatic Flutter detection can solve this by choosing Browse, followed by selecting the Flutter SDK folder located at C:\\flutter and confirming with OK.
    
* Continue by configuring the project name alongside its location.
    
* The creation of the project is completed by selecting Finish.
    

**2\. Run Your Flutter App**

A physical Android device requires a USB connection after activating Developer Mode and USB Debugging features, while Android Emulator needs Android Studio installation.

* Open the main.dart file because it serves as the entry point for your Flutter application within the project folder.
    
* You can begin the application either by pressing the Run button or by hitting Shift + F10.
    

**Step 5:** Verify Flutter Setup

You must execute this command through the CMD or IntelliJ IDEA terminal to verify system correctness:

flutter doctor

This will help determine whether essential packages are correctly installed. Users should implement the provided guidelines to address any arising issues.
