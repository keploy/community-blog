The MacBook Pro with Touch Bar is a high-end laptop made by Apple Inc. that debuted in 2016. It is the flagship of the MacBook Pro line, known for its lean design, high-end hardware, and special features designed specifically for creatives and power users. The Touch Bar is a slim, touch-sensitive OLED strip positioned just above the keyboard, effectively replacing the traditional function key row. 

Essentially, it provides dynamic, context-sensitive controls that switch depending on the application being worked on. Safari can give access to tabs and bookmark items fast; Photos includes rich editing options to crop, filter, and modify effects. It helps boost user productivity by providing shortcuts and tools that dynamically fit to their work pattern. Other features in this model of MacBook Pro include Touch ID, a fingerprint sensor granting secure login and purchases verification. 

A Retina screen features True Tone for vivid colors and sharp images, along with a big Force Touch trackpad for navigating precision. High-performance Intel processors, a large RAM configuration, and SSD drives drive the performance of the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. 

It features Thunderbolt 3 ports that support high-speed data transfers and multiple external display connections. The MacBook Pro had a lot of rave reviews for its amazing design and practicality, but it did receive ample scathing for being unable to provide physical function keys and point of connection limited offerings. Blended reviews did help it register a fair level of popularity among creative professionals dealing with video editing, graphic designing, and music production. 

In 2021, Apple discontinued the Touch Bar in newer models of MacBook Pro, returning to traditional function keys, although it will remain a hallmark in the history of MacBook Pro.
