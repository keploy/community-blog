In our previous blog, we explored how to build a modern web server using BunJs and Prisma, integrating robust authentication mechanisms with JWT tokens. Now, it's time to ensure our application is reliable and error-free through thorough testing.

In this blog, we'll dive into testing methodologies using Cucumber JS and Keploy, both are a powerful tools that streamline the testing process and enhance the quality of our application.

## Understanding the Importance of Testing

By systematically executing test cases, developers can uncover bugs and errors early in the development process, preventing costly issues in later stages. ***For instance***, in our BunJs web application, thorough testing would involve scenarios such as user authentication, post creation, and database interactions. By testing each feature extensively, developers can verify that user authentication works as expected, posts are created and retrieved accurately, and database queries return the correct results.

And testing our BunJs application's authentication mechanism ensures that users can securely sign up, log in, and access protected resources. Additionally, performance testing can validate that the application performs efficiently, even under high traffic loads. By prioritizing testing throughout the development lifecycle, teams can build robust, secure, and user-friendly applications that meet the needs and expectations of their users while minimizing the risk of critical failures and enhancing overall quality.

## Testing BunJs with Cucumber JS

First, let's create our work directory and install necessary dependencies via npm:

```bash
mkdir features && mkdir features/support
npm i @cucumber/cucumber chai
```

Let's move towards writing the tests and setting up folder structures for cucumber-js; this is how the folder structure should look like

```bash
├── features
│   ├── support
│   │   ├── steps.mjs
│   ├── post.feature
```

We have already prepared our folder structure similar to above while installing dependencies,so now let's start with `steps.mjs` file: -

```javascript
import { Given, When, Then } from '@cucumber/cucumber';
import { expect } from 'chai';
import axios from 'axios';

let createdRecipeId;

Given('I have a valid token', async function () {
// Signin to get the valid token
  this.token = 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6Ijk3Y2E1MWUzLWFiMWYtNDdkZC04ODM3LWFmMjkwZGQ1ZDAzYiIsImVtYWlsIjoiaXNzc2FsY3VwbmFtZGVAYWJjLmNvbSIsImlhdCI6MTcxNTU4MjEyNCwiZXhwIjoxNzE1NjY4NTI0fQ.T3WR8TO1uiV9t_ZIPm93JbdgWpYeXiUkRW3CUeyyOVQ';
});

When('I create a new recipe with title {string} and body {string}', async function (title, body) {
  try {
    const response = await axios.post('http://localhost:4040/create-post', {
      title: title,
      body: body,
    }, {
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${this.token}`,
      },
    });
    expect(response.status).to.equal(200);
    if (response.data && response.data.recipe && response.data.recipe.id) {
      createdRecipeId = response.data.recipe.id;
    } else {
      throw new Error('Failed to retrieve recipe ID from response');
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error); // Log any errors
    this.error = error.response.data.error;
  }
});

Then('I should receive a successful response with the created recipe', function () {
  expect(this.error).to.be.undefined;
  expect(createdRecipeId).to.not.be.undefined;
});

Given('I have an invalid token', function () {
  this.token = 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6MSwiZW1haWwiOiJ4eXpAYWJjLmNvbSIsImlhdCI6MTcxMzI1NTk2NSwiZXhwIjoxNzEzMzQyMzY1fQ.0RvrxVrkG6pQNGw0tjcDFqQuhmbVCmUcXuEy1brMED0';
  // Create an Expired Token
});

When('I attempt to create a new recipe with title {string} and body {string}', async function (title, body) {
  try {
    const response = await axios.post('http://localhost:4040/create-post', {
      title: title,
      body: body,
    }, {
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${this.token}`,
      },
    });
    if (response.data && response.data.recipe && response.data.recipe.id) {
      createdRecipeId = response.data.recipe.id;
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error); // Log any errors
    this.error = error.response.data.error;
    this.responseStatus = error.response.status;
  }
});

Then('I should receive an ok response with status code {int}', function (statusCode) {
  expect(this.error).to.be.undefined;
  expect(createdRecipeId).to.not.be.undefined;
});
```

### Writing Feature Files with Gherkin Syntax

Now that we have our step file ready, it's time to create our `post.feature` file based on our steps.

```bash
Feature: Creating a new recipe post

  Scenario: Create a new recipe post with a valid token
    Given I have a valid token
    When I create a new recipe with title "Delicious Pasta" and body "A simple pasta recipe"
    Then I should receive a successful response with the created recipe

  Scenario: Attempt to create a new recipe post with an invalid token
    Given I have an invalid token
    When I attempt to create a new recipe with title "Delicious Pasta" and body "A simple pasta recipe"
    Then I should receive an ok response with status code 200
```

### Executing Tests with Cucumber JS

Now that we have our `post.features` and `steps.mjs` ready to be executed, let's start our application first before running our test.

```bash
# Start our database instance
sudo docker-compose up -d

# Start our application in dev mode
bun --watch index.ts
```

Once we have our application and postgres database instance up and running, we can executed our Cucumber tests:-

```bash
npx cucumber-js
```

We will see that all our test secaniors has passed: -

But what happens once our valid token expire would the test cases still *pass?*  
Let's replace our valid token with invalid token and see if our test cases are still passing or not

```javascript
// existing steps
...
Given('I have a valid token', async function () {
// Replaced the token with invalid token
  this.token = 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6MSwiZW1haWwiOiJ4eXpAYWJjLmNvbSIsImlhdCI6MTcxMzI1NTk2NSwiZXhwIjoxNzEzMzQyMzY1fQ.0RvrxVrkG6pQNGw0tjcDFqQuhmbVCmUcXuEy1brMED0';
});
...
//existing steps
```

Now when we run our tests again we get:-

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1715583211749/e6c818a5-90b6-4c28-a35c-fae23ebd0910.png align="center")

Our first scenario failed as the token we provided was not correct. This is one of the scenario where token has been expired or invalid token, this is a common problem while writting e2e tests with cucumber, each time we have to provide token for the scenario to be passed since after a while they will get expried.

## Introduction to Keploy

Keploy is an Open Source API testing platform to generate Test cases out of data calls along with data mocks.

In simple words, with keploy we don’t have to create or maintain manual test cases. As it records all network interactions from the application and based on expected responses & request it generates test cases and data mocks to make our work easy and efficient.

### Testing BunJs application with Keploy

Let's get started by installing the Keploy with one-click command:-

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keploy/keploy/main/keploy.sh && source keploy.sh
```

You should see something like this:

```bash
       ▓██▓▄
    ▓▓▓▓██▓█▓▄
     ████████▓▒
          ▀▓▓███▄      ▄▄   ▄               ▌
         ▄▌▌▓▓████▄    ██ ▓█▀  ▄▌▀▄  ▓▓▌▄   ▓█  ▄▌▓▓▌▄ ▌▌   ▓
       ▓█████████▌▓▓   ██▓█▄  ▓█▄▓▓ ▐█▌  ██ ▓█  █▌  ██  █▌ █▓
      ▓▓▓▓▀▀▀▀▓▓▓▓▓▓▌  ██  █▓  ▓▌▄▄ ▐█▓▄▓█▀ █▓█ ▀█▄▄█▀   █▓█
       ▓▌                           ▐█▌                   █▌
        ▓

Keploy CLI

Available Commands:
  example         Example to record and test via keploy
  generate-config generate the keploy configuration file
  record          record the keploy testcases from the API calls
  test            run the recorded testcases and execute assertions
  update          Update Keploy

Flags:
      --debug     Run in debug mode
  -h, --help      help for keploy
  -v, --version   version for keploy

Use "keploy [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

Now we are all set to create testcases with keploy.

### Create Tests for our BunJs application

Since Keploy uses eBPF to instrument applications without code changes, all we need to do is pass application running command to keploy:-

```bash
keploy record -c "bun --watch index.ts"
```

Let's make API calls to record the interaction between our BunJs application and Prisma-ORM based Postgres

```bash
## Create User    
curl --request POST \
      --url http://localhost:4040/signup \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      --data '{
        "name":"Yash",
        "email":"isssalcupnamde@rbc.com",
        "password":"1234"
    }'

## Login User
    curl --request POST \
      --url http://localhost:4040/login \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      --data '{
        "email":"isssalcupnamde@rbc.com",
        "password":"1234"
    }'

## Create a Post
curl --request POST \
      --url http://localhost:4040/create-post \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      --header 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJlbWFpbCI6Imlzc3NhbGN1cG5hbWRlQHJiYy5jb20iLCJpYXQiOjE3MTU1ODQzMDYsImV4cCI6MTcxNTY3MDcwNn0.G7llqJc27ZQFunDiNjduMt9FZ2B4MbB0Xbhk_y7pzT0' \
      --data '{
        "title":"Anime",
        "body":"AOT from quantum universe"
    }'
```

We should be able to see something like this:-

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1715584800701/204e7474-5f39-4d1b-83c8-38f06a3d07ca.png align="center")

Once we have our test cases ready, let's execute them in keploy test mode:-

```bash
keploy test -c "bun --watch index.ts"
```

We will notice that one of our test cases failed due to fact the each time the user.token would be different

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1715584941453/4dd67e82-4259-46ec-8a78-b25a11f6378b.png align="center")

So to avoid this keploy provides two feature, time-freezing and denoising, for this blog we are using denoising feature. We know that our `test-2` is failing, so let's open the `test-2.yaml` file : -

```yaml
version: api.keploy.io/v1beta1

    objects: []
    assertions:
        noise:
            header.Date: []
            body.token: []
    created: 1715584309
curl: |-
    curl --request POST \
      --url http://localhost:4040/login \
      --header 'Host: localhost:4040' \

      --data '{
        "email":"isssalcupnamde@rbc.com",
        "password":"1234"
    }'
```

And under noise add `body.token: []` :-

```yaml
    assertions:
        noise:
            header.Date: []
            body.token: []
```

Now let's run our testcases again, we can see that our testcases have passed except one which is failing due the error of prisma which as been reported to prisma here:- [Could not figure out an ID in create · Issue #23907 · prisma/prisma (](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/23907#issuecomment-2089682504)[github.com](http://github.com)[)](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/23907#issuecomment-2089682504)
