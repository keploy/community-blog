Delivering a high quality product is a must in the software development industry. Functionality, performance and user satisfaction can all be severely impacted by defects, also known as bugs or issues. **Defect Management** becomes crucial at this point. In this blog we'll discuss the definition of defects, the importance of properly managing them, and how a systematic Defect Management Process (DMP) guarantees software testing quality and dependability

## What is a Defect?

A defect in software testing refers to a flaw or deviation from the expected behavior of an application. These arise due to incorrect logic, missing functionality, design errors, or unhandled edge cases. Effective identification and management of defects are important in ensuring that the software product is of good quality, reliable, and successful in general since unresolved defects may result in system crashes, security vulnerabilities, and bad user experience.

**Example**: If a login page accepts invalid credentials without any error, it's a defect.

## What is Defect Management?

**Defect management** is the process of identifying, documenting, and tracking defects (bugs or issues) in a software product. It is an important part of the software development process that ensures defects are identified and addressed in a timely manner.

Analyzing bugs that need identification, documentation, monitoring, and addressing large codebases of complex software applications can be a daunting task. In addition, satisfying the expectations of end-users is also crucial. This is where **Defect management** comes to the rescue.

## Defect Management Process(DMP)

Defect Management Process(DMP) is a systematic process of detecting, documenting, prioritizing, fixing, and tracking software defects throughout the whole development life cycle to ensure product quality and reliability.

A proper Defect Management Process involves:

1. Detection - Detecting defects during testing.
    
2. Logging - Recording defects with details.
    
3. Prioritization - Prioritization based on severity and impact.
    
4. Assignment - Assigning the defect to developers.
    
5. Resolution - Fix implementation.
    
6. Verification - Testing the fix.
    

## Why is Defect Management Process important?

* Reduces bugs in production
    
* Improves software reliability
    
* Increases team collaboration
    
* Enables data-driven quality decisions
    

## Phases of Defect Management

Defect management goes through various phases, beginning with defect prevention, deliverable baseline, defect discovery, defect resolution, process improvement, and lastly, defect management and reporting. Each phase makes the defect management process stronger and more effective.

![DMP-phases](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1749662144720/34f208af-00cc-4865-b3df-80b5a95b5807.png align="center")

## Objective of Defect Management Process

The primary aim of the Defect Management Process is to ensure high quality in our software by identifying, controlling, and managing all defects systematically throughout the software development life cycle. This involves:

* **Early Detection**: Finding defects as early as possible within the production life cycle.
    
* **Accurate Tracking**: Accurately capturing each defect and linking it appropriately.
    
* **Effective Prioritization**: Effectively prioritizing defects based on the associated severity and impact.
    
* **Timely Resolution**: Resolving defects in a timely manner to avoid delays or failure in delivery.
    
* **Quality Assurance**: Evaluating/quality checking fixes and ensuring non-recurrence.
    

The defects management process all contributes to shorter reworks, lowered costs, and a more stable and reliable product for the end user.

## Defect Management Lifecycle

The defect management lifecycle describes the stages a software defect goes through, from its initial detection to resolution and closure. It involves reporting, assignment, resolution, retesting, and closure. The number of states that a defect goes through varies from project to project. Below lifecycle diagram, covers all possible states.

![lifecycle-diagram](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1749716315462/fae3b11f-b839-43ac-8f3d-90bcff58589f.png align="center")

## Defect Report and the States

A Defect Report is a written summary of a defect detected during testing. It contains critical information for developers and stakeholders to comprehend, reproduce, and fix the problem.

**A typical defect report consists of:**

* Defect ID
    
* Title and Description
    
* Steps to Reproduce
    
* Expected vs Actual Result
    
* Severity and Priority
    
* Environment Details(OS, browser, etc.)
    
* Attachments(logs, screenshots, videos)
    

**Common Defect States:**

1. New - Defect is reported and pending triage.
    
2. Assigned - Allocated to a developer for fixing.
    
3. In Progress - Developer has initiated working on the defect.
    
4. Fixed - Code alteration has been done to fix it.
    
5. Retest - Testers confirm the fix in the subsequent test cycle.
    
6. Closed - Confirmed to be fixed; problem is solved.
    
7. Rejected - Defect is either invalid or not reproducible.
    
8. Deferred - fix is delayed due to low priority or future scope.
    
9. Duplicate - Similar defect already reported.
    
10. Reopened - Defect still occurs after being reported as closed.

## Quality Metrics for the Defect Management Process

1. **Defect Density:**
    
    * Measures the number of defects relative to the size of the software or product.
        
    * A lower defect density indicates higher code quality.
        
2. **Defect Leakage:**
    
    * Tracks the number of defects that escape into production after testing.
        
3. **Mean Time to Resolution(MTTR):**
    
    * Measures the average time it takes to fix a defect.
        
    * A lower MTTR indicates that the development team is efficient in addressing issues.
        
4. **Defect Resolution Rate:**
    
    * Measures the percentage of defects resolved within a specific period.
        
5. **Defect Removal Efficiency(DRE):**
    
    * Shows the percentage of defects detected and removed before release.
        
    * Helps in assessing the effectiveness of the quality assurance process.

## How to write a good Defect Report

![defect-report](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1749894009955/26e262de-face-4542-9ada-3bbd970d5ac0.png align="center")

**Step 1. Create a Clear and Descriptive Title**

* Summarize the defect in one line.
    
* **Example:** “Login button unresponsive on iOS devices“
    

**Step 2. Provide a Detailed Description**

* Explain the defect with details on what was expected versus what actually occurred.
    
* **Example**: “When attempting to log in, the login button does not respond after entering credentials, while it works correctly on Android devices.”
    

**Step 3. List Steps to Reproduce the Defect**

* Provide a step-by-step guide to replicate the issue.
    
* **Example:**
    
    1. Open the app on iOS device.
        
    2. Enter valid credentials on the login screen.
        
    3. Tap the login button.
        
    4. Observe that the button does not respond.
        

**Step 4. Specify the Environment**

* Include details about the software version, operating system, hardware, and any relevant configurations.
    
* **Example**: “iOS 16.4, iPhone 12, App version 3.2.1”
    

**Step 5. Assign Severity and Priority**

* Indicate the defect’s impact (severity) and the urgency for fixing it (priority).
    
* **Example**:
    
    1. **Severity**: Major (Login functionality is broken)
        
    2. **Priority**: High (Needs immediate attention to prevent user frustration)
        

#### Step 6. Attach Supporting Documentation

* Add screenshots, screen recordings, or log files that illustrate the defect.
    
* **Example**: Attach a screenshot of the unresponsive login button and a video showing the steps to reproduce the defect.
    

#### Step 7. Provide Additional Comments or Observations

* Include any extra details or observations that might help in understanding the defect or its impact.
    
* **Example**: “The issue seems to occur only when the device is in low battery mode.”
    

#### Step 8. Review and Revise

* Before submitting, review the report for completeness and clarity.
    
* **Example**: Check that all fields are filled, the description is clear, and the reproduction steps are accurate.
