Did you know 88% of users don‚Äôt return to sites with poor experiences, even if they offer excellent services and content? It‚Äôs time to recognize that a seamless user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) are essential to a product or company‚Äôs success, not mere luxuries.

This is where **Continuous UI Testing** steps in. Ditching the conventional testing approaches, continuous UI testing integrates itself into almost every step of development & deployment. This not only ensures perfection for all browsers and devices but also achieves precision without slowing down your development pipeline.

In this blog, we‚Äôll explore the role **BrowserStack** and **GitHub Actions**. The former (BrowserStack) allows you to run automated tests on real browsers & devices and ensures unparalleled accuracy. Whereas, GitHub Actions, on the other hand, automates this process, by triggering your testing workflows seamlessly whenever you push code. Let‚Äôs explore how.

## **Why is Continuous UI Testing so Essential?**

In today‚Äôs dynamic environments, neglecting periodic UI testing leads to issues like:

* **Broken Layouts:** Small changes in the code can inadvertently disrupt the design, misplace elements, or cause unresponsive interfaces.
    
* **Faulty cross-browser compatibility:** Your application might seamlessly work in one browser, and end up breaking in another. This can be particularly frustrating for users.
    
* **Poor user experience:** It takes seconds to drive users away with a glitchy interface. This directly impacts your brand reputation and revenue.
    

In any given CI/CD workflow, the risk multiplies with every continuous change in the code. A regular UI Consistency check can highlight such issues & risks before time. It‚Äôs practically feasible to invest in these tests and checks at a building stage, without carrying the headache of expensive fixes, last-minute changes, customer churn, and delayed releases.

### Some high-scale Benefits of Consistent UI Checks are:

* **Enhanced development speed:** If focusing on the long-run path, you do not debug randomly, but solve breakage in your code at the very stage of building. Automated testing enhances speed and innovation.
    
* **Higher reliability:** Continuous testing certainly shrinks the UI bugs that might‚Äôve slipped into production. So, you finally have a consistent performance across all environments!
    

## **Manual Testing vs. Continuous UI Testing:**

| **Aspect** | **Continuous UI Testing** | **Manual Test Techniques** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Execution Time** | Automated & faster | Slow & resource-intensive |
| **Coverage** | Comprehensive across browsers and devices | Limited to selected devices |
| **Scalability** | Scalable with CI/CD workflows. | Difficult to scale with frequent changes |
| **Error Detection** | Consistent & accurate error detection | Prone to human & other errors |
| **Cost Efficiency** | Lower with automation. | Expensive over time due to manual effort |

## **What is BrowserStack ?**

BrowserStack is known to be a leading cloud-based testing platform, which essentially lets developers test their applications across a vast range of browsers, operating systems, and devices. It‚Äôs a perfect replacement for any in-house device lab. BrowserStack‚Äôs additional benefits include:

* **Visual Tests for your platform:** Helps you with a consistent user experience without bothering about platform fragmentation. Seamless detection of visual regressions and enables pixel-perfect designs.

## **What is GitHub Actions?**

It‚Äôs an automation tool that seamlessly integrates with GitHub. ‚ÄòActions‚Äô helps developers to initiate, manage, and trigger the workflows, specifically based on code pushes, PRs (pull requests), or scheduled triggers. Some key features of GitHub Actions are:

* **Parallel Execution**: It essentially helps in running jobs concurrently for saving time and accelerate delivery.
    
* **Customizable Pipelines**: Actions can be so efficient in defining your project workflows by using YAML files tailored to any specific CI/CD needs.
    
* **Wide Integration**: You can seamlessly combine with third-party tools like BrowserStack, or AWS , etc. for any kind of comprehensive automation.
    
* **Event-Driven Workflows**: Probably the best part, it allows task automation, based on repository events, like running tests or deploying your repository code.
    

## **Prerequisites :**

Following is a list of tools that you will require in order to perform the set-up of interface testing with BrowserStack and GitHub Actions:

* A GitHub repository.
    
* Access to BrowserStack (Automate).
    
* [Selenium/Cypress](https://keploy.io/blog/community/cypress-vs-selenium-which-testing-tool-is-right-for-you) test scripts (or an example script provided in the blog).
    

## **How BrowserStack Integrates with GitHub Actions?**

After finally understanding the key deliverables of choosing BrowserStack and GitHub Actions, we can conclude that together they can prove to be effectively robust & automated. Read further to learn how clean it could make your UI testing run on different devices and browsers. Welcome to the Step-by-Step Technical walkthrough for the integration process:

| **Step-1 :** | Event Triggering: Activating Your **Workflow** |
| --- | --- |
| **Step-2 :** | Code Checkout: **Preparing** the Test **Environment** |
| **Step-3 :** | Test **Execution** on BrowserStack: Running **UI Tests** |
| **Step-4 :** | Results Collection and **Reporting** |

Let‚Äôs see detailed approach for each of the four steps given above:

### **<mark>Step-1: Event Trigger: Activating Your Workflow</mark>**

By stating ‚Äúevent-driven‚Äù, we essentially mean that the workflows in GitHub Actions are triggered by the repository event. It works like a doorbell‚Äînothing happens until it is activated, triggering a predefined response.

Similar to that, GitHub Actions has a couple of events by which it could trigger the workflow in a certain way (depending on the event). Some examples are:

* * **Push:** Code is pushed to specific branches (e.g., `main`, `develop`,etc.)
        
        \* **Pull Request (PR):** Initiating, syncing, or merging the pull requests.
        
        \* **Delete:** When a branch or tag is deleted.
        

You can understand these example events with the help of a configuration in any given `.yml` file:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
  delete:  # Trigger workflow when a branch or tag is deleted
```

### **<mark>Step-2: Code Checkout: Preparing the Test Environment</mark>**

Now, the upcoming step in this process is using the workflow in GitHub Actions to fetch your repository codebase. We can fo it with `actions/checkout` action, which will further ensure that all test scripts and configuration files of your repository are succesfully available for execution.

An example of YAML snippet for this could be:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Checkout Repository
    uses: actions/checkout@v3
```

<div data-node-type="callout">
<div data-node-type="callout-emoji">üí°</div>
<div data-node-type="callout-text">By default, the <code>checkout</code> action fetches only the latest commit to speed up workflows. Use <code>fetch-depth: 0</code> for full repository history if required.</div>
</div>

### **<mark>Step-3: Test Execution on BrowserStack: Running UI Tests</mark>**

The key essence of integrating BrowserStack with GitHub Actions lies within executing UI tests seamlessly on BrowserStack‚Äôs powerful infrastructure. This crucial set-up allows the developers to automate any type of cross-browser testing, pretty efficiently. As a result, you get a consistent performance of your application across any varying environment. Here's in detail how test execution is configured in BrowserStack:

1. **Set-Up BrowserStack Credentials:**
    
    * Authenticating test execution will require Access Keys.
        
    * We store these Access Keys securely as ‚ÄòGitHub Secrets‚Äô (`BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME` and `BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY`):
        
        ```yaml
        steps:
          - name: Set BrowserStack Credentials
            env:
              BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME }}
              BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY }}
        ```
        
2. **Installing Dependencies:**
    
    * You must then install the project dependencies based on your project (e.g., Selenium, Cypress). This `.yml` file could be an example:
        
        ```yaml
        steps:
          - name: Install Dependencies
            run: |
              npm install
              npm run build
        ```
        
3. **Executing Tests via BrowserStack CLI or API:**
    
    * Configure the test runner to execute on BrowserStack Automate:  
        Example for Selenium:
        
        ```yaml
        steps:
          - name: Run Selenium Tests on BrowserStack
            run: |
              npx selenium-standalone start &
              npm test
        ```
        
    * Example for Cypress (via BrowserStack Cypress CLI):
        
        ```yaml
        steps:
          - name: Run Cypress Tests on BrowserStack
            run: |
              browserstack-cypress run --sync
        ```
        

### **<mark>Step-4: Results Collection and Reporting</mark>**

BrowserStack, as mentioned above, serves with the perfect report and analytics, by generating it comprehensively for you. These significantly include:

* **Execution Logs**: a set of step-by-step logs for debugging.
    
* **Screenshots**: Captures critical test steps and submits it to you.
    
* **Videos**: Full recordings of test executions that were done in real-time.
    
* **Test Status**: Highlights of the passed, failed, and skipped tests of your application.
    

The mentioned artifacts could easily be linked to the GitHub Actions workflow for easy accessibility. Here‚Äôs how we do it for instance of a `.yml` file.

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Upload Artifacts
    uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
    with:
      name: test-results
      path: ./path-to-results
```

## **Advanced Features of Integration**

1. **Parallel Test Execution:**  
    Run multiple test cases concurrently on different browsers and devices using BrowserStack Automate‚Äôs parallel testing capabilities. This can be configured via the test framework‚Äôs settings (e.g., `maxInstances` in Selenium).
    
2. **Dynamic Browser and Device Matrix:**  
    Define the testing matrix dynamically using JSON configurations, enabling easy updates to browsers and devices under test:
    
    ```json
    {
      "browsers": [
        { "browser": "Chrome", "os": "Windows", "os_version": "10" },
        { "browser": "Safari", "os": "OS X", "os_version": "Monterey" }
      ]
    }
    ```
    
3. **Error Notifications:**  
    Set up notifications for workflow failures using integrations like Slack or email:
    
    ```yaml
    steps:
      - name: Notify Slack
        uses: slackapi/slack-github-action@v1.23.0
        with:
          payload: '{"text":"UI Tests failed on GitHub Actions!"}'
    ```
