In the field of software quality assurance, there are two types of testing often referenced, smoke testing and regression testing. While they are both vital to software quality, each has its own unique functions and overlaps in the software development cycle. This post explores the differences between smoke testing vs regression testing, and when and how to effectively implement each.

## What is Smoke Testing?

Smoke testing, also known as build verification testing, is an initialization testing technique performed to determine for certain that the basic functions of an application are working as intended. The term is from hardware testing, where the first test would be to turn on the device to see if smoke was released - a smoke test fails immediately if the test is a fail.

### Definition and Purpose of Smoke Testing

Smoke testing is a shallow level test that assures that the most important functions of an application works without issues. The primary purpose of smoke testing is to reject a seriously defective application build as early as possible so that time and resources allocated for a future or additional testing on a flawed application are not wasted.

![Smoke Testing](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1748950060091/abb3a65d-1967-4a51-be53-6c0776ce53c2.png align="center")

### Objectives and Scope of Smoke Testing

The main objectives of smoke testing include:

* Verify that mission-critical functionality works
    
* Verify that the application launches correctly
    
* Verify that the user interface is functioning properly
    
* Verify that the fundamental functionality to move the user from screen to screen is functioning
    

Smoke testing is purposely limited in scope; it is wide enough to cover core functionality but does not discover all features through exhaustive testing.

### How Smoke Testing Works

Smoke testing is a simple process:

1. Identify the mission critical functionality that must be working for the application to be considered minimally functional
    
2. Create a set of test cases to test those critical functions
    
3. Run those tests after every new build or deployment
    
4. Evaluate if the build is minimally functional enough to continue testing
    

### The Role of Manual Testing in Smoke Testing

While smoke tests can be automated, manual smoke tests can add value in early development phases. Since testers are providing actionable feedback in the early phases of development, they may still conduct tests to ensure that primary features still work. Humans can catch more apparent problems that the automated scripts won't catch.

### The Role of Crowdtesting in Smoke Testing

Crowdtesting groups use a diverse group of testers to run smoke tests in a variety of environments and devices. This is extremely effective for applications that target a variety of platforms since it can offer quick feedback for mission critical functionality across different configurations.

### Benefits of Smoke Testing

The primary benefits of smoke testing include:

* Detection of major bugs at an early stage
    
* Less time and energy wasted testing basic flawed builds
    
* Faster feedback to developers
    
* More stability in builds before testing them thoroughly
    
* More effective overall quality assurance
    

### Automating Smoke Tests

Automating smoke tests offers significant advantages:

* Tests are able to run automatically after every build
    
* Results are available instantly
    
* Consistency in test execution
    
* Tests run consistently
    

Smoke tests are automated using tools like Selenium, Cypress, and TestComplete. If your application is API-based, consider using tools like Postman or Keploy to automate these tests.

## What is Regression Testing?

Regression testing is a type of software testing that confirms that code changes have not negatively affected existing functionality. Regression testing ensures that previously developed and tested software still performs after a change (like adding functionality, patches, or configuration changes).

![What is regression testing](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1748950177803/ca30862a-db33-4226-b7fb-2432a23fd0d3.jpeg align="center")

### Definition and Purpose of Regression Testing

Regression testing is designed to discover bugs that were inadvertently introduced when new code is integrated or existing code is changed. It is intended to confirm that performance of previously tested functionality has not been affected by any changes made.

### Objectives and Scope of Regression Testing

The primary objectives of regression testing include:

* To confirm fixed bugs remain fixed
    
* To confirm changes (for example to accommodate new features) have not caused new bugs
    
* To confirm that changes have not caused any previously untouched areas of functionality to break
    
* To confirm that the system still conforms to its requirements
    

The scope is broad and can encompass all previously tested functionality that may be affected by changes.

### How Regression Testing Works

Regression testing typically follows these steps:

1. Identify functionality (or certain areas) that may be affected by changes
    
2. Select test cases that carefully cover the identified areas
    
3. Understand which test cases can be reused and which test cases will need adjustments
    
4. Execute test cases that were selected
    
5. Compare with the previous results
    
6. Log details of any results that don't match or regressions discovered

### The Role of Manual Testing in Regression Testing

The Importance of Manual Testing in Regression Testing Automation is the optimal path in regression testing however human immersive manual testing is still critical as regression testing is concerned with human-centric facets in complex real-world scenarios. Testers may focus attention on areas that due to experience and knowledge of the application may be particularly susceptible to being regressed.

### The Role of Crowdtesting in Regression Testing

Crowdtesting provides a scaleable approach to regression testing as you could potentially have multiple testers execute the tests at the same time on different platforms. The whole point of crowdtesting is to engage in a diverse environment to regression test that other tests or environments don't explicitly represent in a defined test environment.

## Smoke Testing vs Regression Testing: Key Differences

If you’re working in the world of software testing, it’s imperative to understand smoke testing and regression testing, their differences, uses, and how to utilize them properly.

**Smoke Testing** will usually happen earlier in the testing cycle, immediately after a new build is delivered. The goal is to test that the essential elements of the application are functioning correctly. This testing is focused on the essentials only. The smoke test doesn't go into depth and is a surface approach. Smoke testing is overall fast testing, like with the smoke test it takes anywhere from minutes to a couple hours to complete. Since you are just verifying that the build is stable enough to begin testing, you will complete only a few critical test cases.

![smoke testing vs regression testing](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1748950047910/5939db88-6abc-4e48-a964-f9671dc7bf63.png align="center")

**Regression testing** will, on the other hand, happen later in the development process, usually after changes to the code. The goal is to ensure that the changes that have been done, have not disrupted previously working functionality. Whereas smoke testing has a limited and narrow scope, regression testing has a vast and expansive scope. Regression testing will reclaim every area that could be affected, and explore those areas in amateur detail. Due to the amount of depth that you might require, the regression testing effort is time consuming and can take anywhere from several hours to a few days. The regression testing effort will encompass hundreds, if not thousands, of test cases.

## When to Use Smoke Testing vs. Regression Testing

The decision to use smoke testing or regression testing depends on your specific situation:

**Use smoke testing when:**

* You receive a new build.
    
* You make big code changes.
    
* You are ready to start detailed testing.
    
* You need or want to test key functionality without going in-depth due to time limits.
    

**Use regression testing when:**

* You add features.
    
* You modify existing code.
    
* You fix defects.
    
* You alter configuration.
    
* You release the product.
    

## Feature Flags in Testing

Feature flags (feature toggles), have the potential to improve the performance of both smoke tests and regression tests.

### Smoke Testing With Feature Flags

Feature flags can enable teams to smoke test new features, while preventing end users to interact with the new feature. This has a multitude of advantages TAs:

* You now are performing testing in a production-like environment.
    
* You can verify critical paths of functionality (with and without new features enabled).
    
* You can help to isolate faults to features.
    
* You can execute quick rollbacks if your smoke test failed.
    

### Regression Testing With Feature Flags

Using feature flags with regression testing you are able to:

* Gradually expose functionality, while checking for regressions.
    
* Test the behavior of a new feature in combination with existing features.
    
* Contrast how the system behaves when features are on or off.
    
* Execute A/B testing of different implementations.

## Conclusion

Smoke testing and regression testing, while serving different, complementary functions, both have their place within the software testing lifecycle. Smoke testing allows developers to quickly verify that core functionalities of an application are easy to test successfully. This makes smoke testing especially useful during the early stages of software development. Regression testing is focused on confirming that new changes do not break existing changes, and as such, is primarily used before a release or changes made to existing code or functionality.

As development teams differentiate between smoke testing and regression testing, they can build more reliable software and make more efficient use of their testing resources. Tools like Keploy can also improve testing efficiency, particularly for API based applications.

Taken together, both smoke testing and regression testing can deepen the quality assurance of your application, and how you implement them determines how effective they will be for your particular project context and constraints.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can smoke testing replace regression testing?

A: No they serve different purposes. Smoke testing verifies basic functionality, while regression testing ensures that the new changes have not broken existing features. Both are necessary to verify quality.

### Q: How often should smoke tests be run?

A: Ideally, smoke tests should be run after every build or deployment. This gives software developers the quickest opportunity to identify any major problems with the application before they invest much time in upstream detail testing.

### Q: Should regression testing always be automated?

A: Regression testing is amenable to automation because of its repetitive and general nature, but there may still be complex testing scenarios that require manual testing. A combination of both options.

### Q: What's the minimum number of test cases for an effective smoke test?

A: This depends on the application, but smoke tests should only cover the most critical paths that would make the application unusable if the path were broken. Generally, this means 10-20 test cases for the majority of applications.

### Q: How do I decide which regression tests to run after a change?

A: Look for functionality directly related to the change, any functionality that operates with the functionality you changed, and any core functionality that must continue to work. Risk-based analysis is a proven method used to prioritize which tests you run first.

### Q: Can smoke testing be performed in production?

A: Yes, smoke testing can be performed in production to verify deployment did not break a critical functionality. Smoke tests should be non-intrusive and only assess read functionality or test accounts if write functionality is required.

### Q: How does Keploy help with reducing test maintenance?

A: The benefit of Keploy's recording and replay usage means that tests are self-adjusting to conscious changes in the response of an API, which eliminates false positives and reduces maintenance burden compared to traditional assertion-based testing tactics.
