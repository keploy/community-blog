In a fast-paced world of software development nowadays, API reliability and performance are most crucial. APIs are called the lifeblood of modern applications in the sense of enabling seamless intercommunication among systems/applications. In that spirit, no-code platforms for API testing are now an extremely useful tool for giving teams the capability to test APIs without extensive programming knowledge. Such platforms allow an intuitive interface and simplify the testing process while also engaging the technical and nontechnical groups.

## **What Are No-Code API Testing Frameworks?**

No-code API testing frameworks that allow users to design and implement API tests without any coding via a visual interface. They support REST, SOAP, GraphQL, and other popular API protocols and are often integrated with a host of other tools forming a complete testing environment.
