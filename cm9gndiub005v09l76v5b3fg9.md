AI coding tools are no longer a novelty. From startups to enterprises, developers are using them to accelerate development, auto-generate tests, and build products faster than ever. Some engineering teams claim they’ve become up to **10x more productive** with the right [**AI coding tool**](https://keploy.io/blog/community/codium-vs-copilot-which-ai-coding-assistant-is-best-for-you) in their workflow.

To get a real-world understanding of how these tools are being used, we hosted a community discussion with over 70 tech leaders—CEOs, CTOs, and engineering managers. Here's a breakdown of what’s working, what’s not, and where **AI in software development** is headed next.

---

## **AI Coding Tools Developers Are Using the Most**

These **generative AI coding tools** came up repeatedly during the session:

* [**GitHub Copilot** –](https://keploy.io/blog/community/codium-vs-copilot-which-ai-coding-assistant-is-best-for-you) Completes code inside your IDE based on context.
    
* **Cursor** – A modern coding environment with built-in **AI coding generator** features.
    
* [**ChatGPT & Claude**](https://keploy.io/blog/community/impact-of-gpt-03-mini-on-tech) – General-purpose AI models that can also write, translate, and debug code.
    
* [**Keploy**](https://keploy.io/) – Generates unit and integration tests directly in GitHub PRs. A game-changer for test automation—no intern needed for test cases anymore.
    
* **Lovable** – Quickly creates UI components from prompts.
    
* **v0** – Converts designs or text prompts into frontend code instantly.
    
* **Replit** – A cloud-based IDE with integrated [**AI coding language**](https://keploy.io/) support.
    
* [**Codeium** –](https://keploy.io/blog/community/codium-vs-copilot-which-ai-coding-assistant-is-best-for-you) A rising star among **GenAI coding tools** for everyday coding help.
    

These tools are far beyond autocomplete—they generate entire functions, test cases, UI layouts, architecture suggestions, and even convert code between programming languages.

## **How Developers Are Using** [**AI Coding Tools in 2025**](https://keploy.io/)

The session included plenty of real use cases showing how developers are integrating **AI coding generators** into their workflow:

* **Code completion & snippets** – Faster coding in environments like VS Code.
    
* **SQL generation** – Writing optimized queries with ChatGPT or Claude.
    
* **Rapid prototyping** – Spinning up full apps (React, Laravel, etc.) in hours.
    
* **Test automation** – Generating unit and end-to-end tests automatically.
    
* **Debugging** – Suggestions for fixing broken code blocks.
    
* **Code translation** – Converting legacy code or shifting between languages.
    

Most teams reported productivity boosts of 20–40%. Some even reported 10x improvements when AI was fully integrated into their stack.

---

## **Examples from Engineering Leaders**

**Code Suggestions in IDEs**  
*Ron Laughton (ReviewInc)* shared how Copilot in Visual Studio often finishes his thoughts with working code, saving significant time.

**Complex SQL Queries**  
*Dan Perez (Aquent)* uses Copilot for daily tasks, but prefers ChatGPT for writing intricate database queries.

**Auto-Generated Tests**  
Teams are using **AI coding tools** to automatically generate unit and integration tests by inputting a function or endpoint.

**Language Conversion**  
Developers are leveraging **generative AI coding tools** to move codebases between languages—enabling flexibility without rewriting everything manually.

---

## **How AI Tools Help Build MVPs Faster**

Some companies are building MVPs at unprecedented speed using **GenAI coding tools**.

**One-Month MVP**  
*Philippe Dallaire (Consuly)* used Claude to build an MVP in under a month—a process that typically takes up to a year. A senior engineer still planned the structure, but the execution was handled with AI help.

**Frontend Development Without Prior Experience**  
*Nikhil Nathar (AvanSaber)* used Lovable and Cursor to build a React app without deep React knowledge. Prompts like "create a dashboard with a sidebar" returned functional frontend code needing minimal cleanup.

---

## **Will AI Replace Developers?**

One of the most debated questions was around hiring trends. Here's what the group concluded:

* **Fewer junior roles** – Many basic tasks are now handled by **AI coding generators**.
    
* **Senior engineers are still essential** – Architecture, system design, and smart use of AI still require expertise.
    
* **Team structures are changing** – Some are hiring more because their team’s output has increased; others are scaling down.
    

*Christian Frunze (GetKen.ai)* expanded his team after AI helped them ship faster. Meanwhile, *Jayakrishnan Melethil (CodeLynks)* cut R&D costs by 30% with AI, yet maintained output. AI changes team needs—but not always in predictable ways.

---

## **Using AI for Testing and QA**

AI-powered test automation was a hot topic.

* **End-to-end testing** – Tools like Keploy AI, TestRigor, Functionize, and Mabl can auto-generate full test suites.
    
* **Review bots** – Jayakrishnan’s team uses bots that check PRs for bugs before human reviewers step in.
    

These tools are especially helpful for standard test cases. For complex logic or permission workflows, human oversight is still required.

*HD Vo* noted that while half the tests are now generated by AI, the rest still need refining.

---

## **The Rise of Agentic AI**

Some forward-thinking teams are trying **agentic AI coding tools**—models that:

* Understand developer goals
    
* Modify code
    
* Commit to GitHub
    
* Run and verify tests
    

*Joseph Khorshed (Cequens)* rebuilt their site using an agentic AI assistant. He rated it **8/10** for that task. Others placed general effectiveness around **3–6/10**. But momentum is building fast.

---

## **Risks and Challenges of AI Coding Tools**

Despite the benefits, leaders shared concerns:

* **Security** – Avoid uploading full codebases to public models.
    
* **IP issues** – Ensure your code isn’t being used to train public models.
    
* **Model limits** – Large or complex codebases still confuse AI tools.
    
* [**Code quality**](https://keploy.io/blog/community/code-quality-with-automated-tools) – Faster output doesn’t always mean better quality. Refactoring may still be needed.
    
* **Skill development** – Junior developers may skip foundational learning if over-reliant on AI.
    

If your work involves sensitive data (fintech, healthcare, etc.), consider **self-hosted GenAI coding tools** or enterprise-grade solutions with privacy safeguards.

---

## **Best Practices for Using AI Coding Tools**

Here’s what experienced teams recommend for successful AI adoption:

* **Start small** – Try it on a side project or non-critical task.
    
* **Train your devs** – Teaching prompt writing and tool selection is essential.
    
* **Always review** – Don’t deploy AI-generated code without a sanity check.
    
* [**Integrate into CI/CD**](https://keploy.io/blog/community/top-ci-tools-for-efficient-software-development) – Use bots to generate and review tests automatically.
    
* **Track your speedup** – Measure how much faster your team ships.
    
* **Secure your repos** – Avoid uploading sensitive data to public tools.
    
* **Maintain test coverage** – Regenerate tests when your code changes.
    
* **Debug manually** – AI can help, but it’s not infallible.

## **What’s Next for AI in Coding (Next 24 Months)**

The community shared strong predictions for what’s coming:

* **AI will handle more routine tasks** – From bug fixes to boilerplate code.
    
* **Junior roles will shrink** – As **AI coding generators** take over simple tasks.
    
* **Design and architecture matter more** – Developers will shift focus to higher-level thinking.
    
* **More integration with design tools** – Think: UI auto-updates as you change prompts.
    
* **QA will be AI-augmented** – With more AI-generated documentation and testing, but human checks are still vital.

## **Final Thoughts**

**AI coding tools** are transforming the way we build software. Used right, they can:

* Accelerate MVPs
    
* Lower dev costs
    
* Improve test coverage
    
* Let senior devs focus on high-impact work
    

But they also introduce new challenges—around quality, security, and developer growth.
