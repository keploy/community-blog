What's the first thing that comes to your mind when you hear **"mocking"**?

Is it an expression when you laugh by making fun of something? Well, If yes, don't worry you are not alone as I thought the same initially. But, with time I understood the meaning of mocking concerning testing. So, let's unfold the concepts of Mocking one by one for you.

---

We know testing is important because if there are any bugs or errors in the software, they can be identified early and fixed before the software product is in the production stage.

But, Unit tests are designed to test the behaviour of specific classes or methods without depending upon the behaviour of their dependencies like databases. Since we‚Äôre testing the smallest ‚Äúunit‚Äù of code, we don‚Äôt need to use actual implementations of these dependencies, and this is where the concept of test doubles as mocks arise.

### What are Mocks and Mocking Frameworks?

**Mocks** are clones of the real object in testing, (For example, a clone of the live database). They hold some predefined data and provide them to answer the calls during testing.

**Mocking frameworks** are used to generate replacement objects like Mocks. By isolating the dependencies, they help the unit testing process and help developers in writing more focused and concise unit tests. The tests also perform faster by truly isolating the system under test. Thus, to make our life easy, we have frameworks like *<mark>Keploy and Mockito.</mark>*

## What is Mockitoüçπ?

* [Mockito](https://github.com/mockito/mockito)¬†is a java-based mocking framework that is used to create simple test APIs for performing unit testing of Java applications.
    
* The framework allows the creation of test doubles objects in automated unit tests for test-driven development.
    
* Mockito has an implementation for¬†[Kotlin](https://github.com/mockito/mockito-kotlin)¬†and¬†[Scala](https://github.com/mockito/mockito-scala)¬†too.
    

Consider an example of Spring Boot (a java-based framework) app, to understand the working of Mockito.

Every web application has an n-tier architecture to divide the application into physical tiers and logical layers. Similarly, a Controller-Service-Repository pattern is prevalent in Spring Boot applications.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1676861994280/bc430df8-e4ce-4103-9f22-05cf4817acf5.png align="center")

* **Controller layer**: It is responsible for defining the functionality so that it can be consumed.
    
* **Service layer**: It is dedicated to implementing the business logic of the functionality defined at the Controller layer.
    
* **Repository layer**: It maintains the property of data storage and fetching data.
    

Whenever a unit of software is called, it first hits the <mark>Controller</mark> to find the functionality, the <mark>request is forwarded</mark> to the <mark>Service layer</mark> for implementation of the called unit and the <mark>data</mark> if required to be <mark>fetched</mark>, it hits the <mark>Repository layer</mark>.

Now you know what mocks are, so, when a function here is called, it hits the Controller and passes the request to the Service layer and then the mocks created using a framework like Mockito are used for testing.

With Mockito, we create a mock and tell Mockito what to do when specific methods are called on it, and then use the mock instance in the test instead of the real dependency. After the test, we can query the mock to see what specific methods were called.

### A sample application with OkHttp library implementing Mockito

Let's consider an application that uses the [OkHttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp/) library to make requests and then retrieve the responses.

We'll use two different URL's to pass as requests:

1. "[**http://google.com**](http://google.com)"
    
2. "[**http://example.com**](http://example.com)"
    

Let's start by creating a maven project in your preferred IDE, I'll be using Eclipse. Continue by adding all the needed dependencies to the pom.xml file as shown below.

```apache
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.squareup.okhttp3</groupId>
            <artifactId>okhttp</artifactId>
            <!--<version>4.10.0</version>-->
            <version>3.14.9</version>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>junit</groupId>
            <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
            <version>4.13.2</version>
            <scope>test</scope>
        </dependency>
		<dependency>
		    <groupId>org.mockito</groupId>
		    <artifactId>mockito-all</artifactId>
		    <version>2.0.0-beta</version>
		    <scope>test</scope>
		</dependency>
		<dependency>
		    <groupId>org.mockito</groupId>
		    <artifactId>mockito-core</artifactId>
		    <version>5.3.0</version>
		    <scope>test</scope>
		</dependency>
    </dependencies>
```

Let's begin by creating a HttpCall class under `src/main/java`. The <mark>HttpCall</mark> class has two methods named <mark>getResponse()</mark> and <mark>getResponse2()</mark> that make HTTP requests and return the response body as a String. The constructor initializes the client variable declared as an instance of OkHttpClient.

```java
package org.example;

import okhttp3.OkHttpClient;
import okhttp3.Request;
import okhttp3.Response;

public class HttpCall {
    private OkHttpClient client;

    public HttpCall() {
        this.client = new OkHttpClient();
    }

    public void setClient(OkHttpClient client) {
        this.client = client;
    }

    public String getResponse2() throws Exception {
        Request request = new Request.Builder()
                .url("http://google.com")
                .get()
                .build();

        try (Response response = client.newCall(request).execute()) {
            int responseCode = response.code();
            System.out.println("Response Code : " + responseCode);
            assert response.body() != null;
            String responseBody = response.body().string();
            System.out.println(responseBody);
            return responseBody;
        } catch (Exception exception) {
            System.out.println(exception);
        }
        return "";
    }

    public String getResponse() throws Exception {
        Request request = new Request.Builder()
                .url("http://example.com")
                .get()
                .build();

        try (Response response = client.newCall(request).execute()) {
            int responseCode = response.code();
            System.out.println("Response Code : " + responseCode);
            assert response.body() != null;
            String responseBody = response.body().string();
            System.out.println(responseBody);
            return responseBody;
        } catch (Exception exception) {
            System.out.println(exception);
        }
        return "";
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        HttpCall httpCall = new HttpCall();
        httpCall.getResponse();
        httpCall.getResponse2();
    }
}
```

<mark>setClient()</mark> method sets the "client" variable to the passed-in OkHttpClient object.

Let's now talk about our two major methods which will be responsible for making requests,

1. <mark>getResponse() method</mark> creates a new HTTP GET request to the URL "[**http://example.com**](http://example.com)" using the `Request.Builder` class from OkHttp. The request is executed using the "client" object's newCall() method and the response is retrieved as a Response object.
    
2. <mark>getResponse2() method</mark> is similar to the getResponse() method, but it requests the URL "[**http://google.com**](http://google.com)".
    

Lastly, under the main() method, we create an instance of the HttpCall class and call both getResponse() and getResponse2() methods on it.

**It's time to mock our responses using Mockito...**

Let's create another class named as <mark>HttpCallTest</mark> inside `src/test/java`, which will be a unit test for a class called `HttpCall` using the JUnit and Mockito frameworks.

```java
import okhttp3.*;

import org.example.HttpCall;
import org.junit.*;
import org.mockito.*;

import java.io.IOException;

import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;

public class HttpCallTest {
    private HttpCall httpCall;
    private OkHttpClient client;

    @Before
    public void setUp() {
        client = mock(OkHttpClient.class);
        httpCall = new HttpCall();
        httpCall.setClient(client);
    }

    @Test
    public void testGetResponse() throws Exception {
        Request request = new Request.Builder()
                .url("http://example.com")
                .get()
                .build();

        Response response = new Response.Builder()
                .request(request)
                .protocol(Protocol.HTTP_1_1)
                .code(200)
                .message("")
                .body(ResponseBody.create(MediaType.parse("text/plain"), "response body"))
                .build();

        when(client.newCall(request).execute()).thenReturn(response);

        String responseBody = httpCall.getResponse();

        verify(client).newCall(request).execute();

        Assert.assertEquals("response body", responseBody);
    }

    @Test
    public void testGetResponse2() throws Exception {
        Request request = new Request.Builder()
                .url("http://google.com")
                .get()
                .build();

        Response response = new Response.Builder()
                .request(request)
                .protocol(Protocol.HTTP_1_1)
                .code(200)
                .message("")
                .body(ResponseBody.create(MediaType.parse("text/plain"), "response body"))
                .build();

        when(client.newCall(request).execute()).thenReturn(response);

        String responseBody = httpCall.getResponse2();

        verify(client).newCall(request).execute();

        Assert.assertEquals("response body", responseBody);
    }
}
```

We have created a <mark>setup() method</mark> which is called before each test method and creates a mock `OkHttpClient` object which is then set as the client for the `HttpCall` instance.

The <mark>testGetResponse()</mark> and <mark>testGetResponse2()</mark> methods are responsible for testing <mark>getResponse()</mark> and <mark>getResponse2()</mark> methods of the `HttpCall` class, respectively.

In these methods, a mock HTTP request is created using the OkHttp `Request.Builder` and expected responses are created using the `Response.Builder` which is responsible for providing the dummy data needed to generate mocks and test behaviour.

<mark>when()</mark> method of the Mockito framework is used to specify that the `execute()` method of the mock client should return the expected response when given the mock request.

Now, to verify that the <mark>execute()</mark> method of the mock client was called with the mock request or not we use the <mark>verify()</mark> method.

Then finally, the <mark>Assert.assertEquals()</mark> method is used to compare the actual response body returned by the `getResponse()` or `getResponse2()` method with the expected response body.

Now, run the file as a JUnit configuration by setting the correct classpath. The details of the execution will be shown on your console.

**But still, we are needed to write a long test script providing the dummy data for the generation of mocks. This is too much, right? Can this be eased? The answer is Yes. <mark>Let's check out Keploy.</mark>**

## Auto-generation of Mocks using Keploy üê∞

[KEPLOY](https://github.com/keploy/keploy) is an e2e test generation platform, responsible for generating mocks and test cases automatically by making API calls. It eliminates the need of writing long test scripts and mocks and even escalates the test coverage to nearly double.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1676918060409/5de59673-ad8c-4d7c-984e-5c87d5ce33eb.png align="center")

Keploy has a [Java SDK](https://github.com/keploy/java-sdk) and it supports frameworks like Spring Boot, SQL Driver, DynamoDB, PostgreSQL, OracleDB, MariaDB and many more.

With Keploy, you set the server in record mode and make a few API calls which will <mark>record the test cases</mark> from <mark>request</mark>, and <mark>response</mark> and <mark>mocks the dependencies</mark> used. These test cases can be replayed anytime later. Now, if we stop the application server, then in the absence of the dependency too, we'll able to generate test runs with increased coverage.

### Integrate Keploy into your application

* To start with build configuration by adding *<mark>keploy-sdk</mark>* as a dependency in *pom.xml* and sync the dependencies to *build.gradle*:
    

```java
<dependency>
     <groupId>io.keploy</groupId>
     <artifactId>keploy-sdk</artifactId>
     <version>1.2.8</version>          <!--  use latest release -->
</dependency>
```

* Download the latest jar from [**here**](https://search.maven.org/artifact/io.keploy/keploy-sdk/1.2.6/jar) (eg: 1.2.8) to mock external/internal dependency calls like DB queries, GMaps, S3, etc. Add the jar into the `main` directory
    
    * Add `-javaagent:` prefix with absolute classpath of Keploy jar downloaded through either of 3 ways:-
        
        * <details data-node-type="hn-details-summary"><summary>Using Intellij</summary><div data-type="detailsContent">Go to <code>Edit Configuration</code>-&gt; <code>add VM options</code> -&gt; paste <code>-javaagent:/Users/jhon/project/src/main/agent-1.2.8.jar</code> -&gt; <code>OK</code>.</div></details>
        * <details data-node-type="hn-details-summary"><summary>Using Command Line</summary><div data-type="detailsContent">export JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -javaagent:/Users/jhon/project/src/main/agent-1.2.8.jar"</div></details>
        * <details data-node-type="hn-details-summary"><summary>Running via Tomcat Server</summary><div data-type="detailsContent">export CATALINA_OPTS="$CATALINA_OPTS -javaagent:/Users/jhon/project/src/main/agent-1.2.8.jar"</div></details>

### Mocking OkHttp calls with Keploy

Java-SDK supports the mocking feature for unit tests, where you write your unit test cases and use Keploy-generated mocks(kmocks) as stubs.

We'll take the same example as taken for the Mockito, but we'll do slight changes in the classes,

1. Let's remove the dependencies for Mockito from `pom.xml` and add for Keploy-SDK as shown above.
    
2. In `HttpCall class`, removed the <mark>setClient()</mark> method as it will no longer be required when we write a JUnit test for this call. Also, a default constructor for HttpCall will work. After making changes, the Class will look as shown below.
    
    ```java
    package org.example;
    
    import okhttp3.OkHttpClient;
    import okhttp3.Request;
    import okhttp3.Response;
    
    public class HttpCall {
        public HttpCall() {
    
        }
    
        public String getResponse2() throws Exception {
            OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient();
            Request request = new Request.Builder()
                    .url("http://google.com")
                    .get()
                    .build();
    
            try (Response response = client.newCall(request).execute()) {
                int responseCode = response.code();
                System.out.println("Response Code : " + responseCode);
                assert response.body() != null;
                String responseBody = response.body().string();
                System.out.println(responseBody);
                return responseBody;
            } catch (Exception exception) {
                System.out.println(exception);
            }
            return "";
        }
    
        public String getResponse() throws Exception {
            OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient();
            Request request = new Request.Builder()
                    .url("http://example.com")
                    .get()
                    .build();
    
            try (Response response = client.newCall(request).execute()) {
                int responseCode = response.code();
                System.out.println("Response Code : " + responseCode);
                assert response.body() != null;
                String responseBody = response.body().string();
                System.out.println(responseBody);
                return responseBody;
            } catch (Exception exception) {
                System.out.println(exception);
            }
            return "";
        }
    
        public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
            HttpCall httpCall = new HttpCall();
            httpCall.getResponse();
            httpCall.getResponse2();
        }
    }
    ```
    
3. Let's write a fresh JUnit test importing MockLib Class of Keploy-SDK which is responsible for the auto-generation of mocks.
    
    ```java
    import io.keploy.service.mock.MockLib;
    import org.example.HttpCall;
    import org.junit.Test;
    
    import static org.junit.Assert.assertTrue;
    
    public class HttpCallTest {
        @Test
        public void testHttpCall() throws Exception {
            new MockLib("example test 2");
    
            HttpCall httpCall = new HttpCall();
            String response = httpCall.getResponse();
            if (response != null) {
                assertTrue(true);
            }
            assert response != null;
            assertTrue(response.contains("example"));
        }
    
        @Test
        public void testHttpCall2() throws Exception {
            new MockLib("google test 2");
    
            HttpCall httpCall = new HttpCall();
            String response = httpCall.getResponse2();
            if (response != null) {
                assertTrue(true);
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    

In <mark>testHttpCall()</mark> method, a `MockLib` object is created with the argument <mark>"example test 2"</mark>. Then, an instance of `HttpCall` is created and the <mark>getResponse()</mark> method is called, which should return a response from an HTTP GET request to "[**http://example.com**](http://example.com)". If the response is not null, the test passes. Additionally, the test asserts that the response is not null and contains the string "example".

Similarly, in <mark>testHttpCall2()</mark> method, a `MockLib` object is created with the argument <mark>"google test 2"</mark>. which accounts for calling <mark>getResponse2()</mark> method, and should return a response from an HTTP GET request to "[**http://google.com**](http://google.com)". If the response is not null, the test passes.

Let's quickly set the configuration for running the file as JUnit,

Right-click on the HttpCallTest class from the project structure and go to `Properties>Run/Debug Settings` and create an instance of JUnit run configuration.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1681974250078/b45946d6-ee35-4448-b1c1-899b0c44ecc1.png align="center")

* Set the VM arguments by setting the path of the jar file to `javaagent`.
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1681974415046/75fb9bc7-b6ba-40c2-91ef-f81fd408af08.png align="center")

* Lastly, set the environment variable KEPLOY\_MODE as record to record the mocks when the test class is executed.
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1681974493029/e3e309b9-f0e8-4f88-bd82-2d281acca8ea.png align="center")

Let's run the test file along with the configuration set and make sure that <mark>Keploy Server</mark> is running in the background.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1681975108952/03eff86f-b7c1-49ad-af3d-00effae67014.png align="center")

As a result, the mock files will be captured and generated under `src/test/e2e/mocks`.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1681976720743/6e76723e-377d-4a8d-98fa-68c14b0fc992.png align="center")

ü§© See, we didn't even need to create a stub for our unit test cases, it's all generated using the [java-sdk](https://github.com/keploy/java-sdk) mock library.
