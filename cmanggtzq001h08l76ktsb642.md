## The Best AI Code Assistants You Won’t Wanna Miss

### 1) Supermaven: “**The fastest copilot”:**

Not everybody has heard about this AI code Assistant, but those who know don’t switch to other AI tools. Supermaven is not any ordinary AI code tool.

![Supermaven logo](https://supermaven.com/_next/static/media/white-logo-text.5e0e8728.svg align="left")

Supermaven was founded by [Jacob Jackson](https://twitter.com/jbfja), who previously created **Tabnine**, the first product to use AI for code completion.

**Great developers deserve great tools. And, that’s why as a Great Developer, Supermaven must be your 1st choice when leveraging the best AI Code Assistant.**

Why? What makes Supermaven so good?

**Supermaven** is the **fastest inline code suggestion** assistant, with a powerful model that most people prefer to *GitHub Copilot* because of its **speed**. Unlike other assistants, it sees the diff between your code and the most recent commit, which helps it understand what you're trying to accomplish.

The Supermaven **Free Tier** allows you to try Supermaven for free!

![Pricing plan card showing 'Free Tier' of "Supermaven" with a cost of $0 per month, offering benefits like fast, high-quality code suggestions, compatibility with large codebases, and a 7-day data retention limit.](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1745683153433/ef4b5e0b-8d6f-4a95-a2a9-f751002934f5.png align="center")

In the paid tier they provide **<mark>1 million </mark>** <mark>Token context window</mark>. But don’t worry, even though the Free Tier doesn't include their [unique 1 million token context window](https://supermaven.com/blog/benchmarking-long-context), but it can still see all your recently opened files, giving it the information it needs to be useful to you.

So, you’re a web developer? You love TypeScript? Supermaven is here to help you.

<iframe width="900" height="600" src="https://supermaven-public2.s3.amazonaws.com/videos/typescript.mp4">
</iframe>

Supermaven was trained on repos like **TypeScript**, **DefinitelyTyped**[,](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) and **LlamaIndexTS** so you can get the best suggestions for your TypeScript code.

Didn’t get satisfied? Oh so you actually work with lower level languages? A devotee of the cult trinity (C, C++ and Assembly)? Don’t worry! Supermaven has you covered! And if you think no AI is capable yet to perform good at low level languages like assembly and C then let me prove you wrong!

Supermaven was trained on repos like **TensorFlow**, **OpenCV**, **nlohmann/json**, and **Frozen** so you can get the best suggestions for C++. Code C++ with the **speed of light** just like shown in the demo video -

<iframe width="800" height="600" src="https://supermaven-public2.s3.amazonaws.com/videos/cpp.mp4"></iframe>

Also it is trained on repos like **HelloSilicon**, **arpilisp**, **Apollo-11**, and **MS-DOS** so you can get the best Assembly code suggestions.

<iframe width="800" height="600" src="https://supermaven-public2.s3.amazonaws.com/videos/assembly.mp4">
</iframe>

This is just scratching the surface, when you will try it will see in your own eyes the convenience and power of this AI assistant.

This best thing about supermaven that truly sets it apart is - 1. less resource overhead(very lightweight), 2. faster than faster, 3. Easy Code Editor integration, 4. Huge enough Context Window, 5. Intelligent inline code suggestion.

If you don’t want to migrate to a whole new AI first Code Editor (like cursor, which we will discuss about next), Supermaven seemingly is the right choice for you. Get AI Code Assistance right within your favourite IDE.

**Supermaven also provides a powerful Chat mode, that is only accessible in VS Code and JetBrains IDEs (NOT in Neovim).**

Supermaven provides integration with the widest adopted and the most popular Code Editors(VS Code, Neovim and the JetBrains Family) within no Complex Setup or Configuration.

![Instructions for installing the "Supermaven" extension in VS Code, including searching for it in the Extensions tab, installing, and reloading the editor if needed. A "Download Now" button is also visible. Also instructions for  Neovim and JetBrains are available but hidden.](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1745683473515/eabec488-127d-40ad-833d-15226db3286f.png align="center")

Neovim setup lua code for Supermaven using `Lazy.nvim` as plugin manager -

```nginx
 local spec = {
  "supermaven-inc/supermaven-nvim",
  config = function()
    require("supermaven-nvim").setup({
      keymaps = {
        accept_suggestion = "<Tab>",
        clear_suggestion = "<C-x>",
        accept_word = "<C-j>",
      },
    })
    vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, "CmpItemKindSupermaven", {fg ="#6CC644"})
  end
}

return spec
```

### 2) Cursor AI - The AI First Code Editor

![Cursor AI home Page](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1745685879526/c34f99fa-1f79-4590-8cdf-5c52c98bfa8c.png align="center")

**Cursor AI** is a smart code editor that's turning heads. It's not just another text editor - it's a coding assistant that helps you work faster and smarter.

As the website says, **Cursor** is explicitly built as an "AI-first" code editor. It is built on top of VS Code and has tight and built-in AI integration that is a masterpiece of Human Innovation in Software Development.

Based on what "AI-First" Design Philosophy says - The AI in **Cursor** is not just an add-on; it's deeply integrated into the core of the editor. Features like intelligent code completion, codebase chat, and AI-powered editing are central to its design and workflow. It's built from the ground up with AI as a primary partner.

**Key Benefits of Cursor:**

* Uses multiple AI models to understand and generate code.
    
* Get answers from your codebase or refer to files or docs. Use the model’s code in one click.
    
* Offers AI code completion, error correction, and natural language commands.
    
* Cursor can suggest multiple edits at once, saving you time.
    
* Cursor predicts your next cursor position so you can seamlessly navigate your code.
    
* You can reference popular libraries using `@LibraryName`, or add your own using `@Docs` → Add new doc.
    
* Get up-to-date information from the internet with `@Web`. Cursor will search the web for you and use the latest information to answer your question.
    

While JetBrains IDEs and VS Code offer powerful AI integrations (JetBrains AI Assistant, GitHub Copilot, Codeium, etc.), these are typically implemented as extensions or plugins. This can sometimes lead to a less seamless and more compartmentalized experience compared to Cursor's native integration. The core functionality of these editors remains centered around traditional code editing paradigms.

Most importantly, **Cursor** offers an **<mark>"Agent"</mark>** mode that can autonomously complete tasks end-to-end, including generating code across multiple files and even running terminal commands (with user confirmation). This level of proactive automation is what truly sets it apart from other code Editors or AI coding Assistants.

![Screenshot of Cursor AI Agent mode description in the website, showing features like "Finds Context", "Runs Commands", and "Loops on Errors". The tool helps integrate Tailwind CSS, runs terminal commands, and detects errors, providing solutions to enhance programming efficiency.](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1745685986167/d574e951-1a5a-4807-aad9-4d9b4dd1e3fc.png align="center")

It is exciting to know that - Initially, Supermaven worked to [build their own editor](https://supermaven.com/blog/funding-announcement), but they were also in touch with the Cursor team, and as they came to know them better the Supermaven team felt they could build a much more useful product together than Supermaven could build alone. That's why Supermaven joined Cursor. And, surprize! Cursors AI completion is also powered by Supermaven! How cool!

Cursor also has a powerful MCP plugin system that allows you to connect Cursor to external systems and data sources. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context and tools to LLMs.

MCP servers can be **written in any language** that can print to `stdout` or serve an HTTP endpoint. MCP servers are lightweight programs that expose specific capabilities through the standardized protocol. They act as intermediaries between AI Agents(Cursor in our case) and external tools or data sources.

Configuring MCP servers in Cursor is also fairly straightforward. Look at the code snippet below -

```json
// This example demonstrated an MCP server using the stdio format
// Cursor automatically runs this process for you
// This uses a Python server, ran with `python`
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "server-name": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["mcp-server.py"],
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "value"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<div data-node-type="callout">
<div data-node-type="callout-emoji">💡</div>
<div data-node-type="callout-text">The <code>env</code> field allows you to specify environment variables that will be available to your MCP server process. This is particularly useful for managing API keys and other sensitive configuration.</div>
</div>

I know this can be a lot to take in. So why not explore Cursor on your own? There is a lot to explore and experience!
