* **Playwright**: Playwright has useful debugging tools built-in: auto-waits for elements, trace viewer, built-in video recording support, auto-retry for tests, etc. Each of these features help developers identify issues more easily, create tests more smoothly, and improve developer satisfaction or happiness.
    

#### **Cross-Browser and Language Support**

* **Selenium**: Selenium has a wide breadth of support to many browsers and programming languages that it is very well-suited for cross-browser testing!
    
* **Playwright**: While Playwright can comfortably work with Chromium, Firefox and WebKit, it tends to favor modern web apps. Its native support for Javascript and Typescript ideally suits people developing using these languages, but there is also Python and C# support.
    

#### **Tooling and Ecosystem**

* **Selenium**: The Selenium ecosystem is mature, and is also well-supported by mobile testing tools like Appium, test management tools like TestNG and containerization like Docker. The only difficulty is linking these integrations together sometimes it is very time-consuming.
    
* **Playwright**: The ecosystem surrounding Playwright is rapidly developing, and Playwright Test has many "out of the box" features such as running tests in parallel to save time and automatic retrying of failed tests. It is now even easier to integrate into modern CI/CD pipelines.
    

### **Use Cases and Suitability**

#### **When to Choose Selenium**

* Legacy applications that need to be tested across a variety of browsers.
    
* Compatibility with older browsers (e.g., Internet Explorer) is crucial.
    
* When testing across multiple languages and platforms, or when evaluating differences like [**system testing vs integration testing**](https://keploy.io/blog/community/system-testing-vs-integration-testing), Selenium provides a stable ecosystem.
    
* If your team is already familiar with Selenium's ecosystem.
    

#### **When to Choose Playwright**

* When building modern web applications or single-page applications (SPAs) that need to be end-to-end tested quickly and reliably.
    
* When the goal is speed as a value over all else, and to be able to debug, and in parallel.
    
* When your team primarily develops in a JavaScript/TypeScript environment.
