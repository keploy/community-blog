Now-a-days the data needs to be shared across different systems and platforms. One of the most common formats for this data exchange is JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). Understanding how to properly handle special characters in JSON is crucial for ensuring data integrity.

In this blog, we’ll explore JSON escape and unescape, explain their importance. ***So let's get started!***

## What is JSON?

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. JSON is often used to send data between servers and web applications.

Here’s a simple example of JSON:

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 25,
  "isStudent": false,
  "hobbies": ["reading", "sports", "music"]
}
```

This JSON object describes a person with a name, age, student status, and a list of hobbies.

## What is JSON Escape?

**JSON escape** refers to the process of converting certain characters in a JSON string to their escaped representations. This ensures the JSON data remains valid and can be safely transmitted and interpreted by different systems.

## Why Do We Need to Escape Characters?

Some characters have special meanings in JSON. For example, double quotes are used to define string values. If you need to include a double quote within a string, you must escape it to prevent it from being interpreted as the end of the string.

### Common Escape Sequences in JSON

Here are some common escape sequences in JSON:

* `\"` : Escaped double quote
    
* `\\` : Escaped backslash
    
* `\/` : Escaped forward slash (optional but often used)
    
* `\b` : Backspace
    
* `\f` : Form feed
    
* `\n` : Newline
    
* `\r` : Carriage return
    
* `\t` : Horizontal tab
    
* `\uXXXX` : Unicode escape sequence for special characters
    

### Example of JSON Escape

Imagine you have the following string that you want to include in a JSON object:

```json
He said, "Hello, World!" and then left.
```

To include this in a JSON object, you need to escape the double quotes inside the string:

```json
{
  "message": "He said, \"Hello, World!\" and then left."
}
```

## How to Escape JSON

Most programming languages provide libraries to handle JSON escaping. Here’s how you can do it in Python and JavaScript.

### Python

In Python, there is `json` module which is use to escape characters:

```python
import json

data = {
    "message": 'He said, "Hello, World!" and then left.'
}
escaped_json = json.dumps(data)

print(escaped_json)
```

**Output**:

```json
{"message": "He said, \"Hello, World!\" and then left."}
```

#### JavaScript

In JavaScript, `JSON.stringify` method can be used:

```javascript
let data = {
  message: 'He said, "Hello, World!" and then left.'
};
let escapedJson = JSON.stringify(data);

console.log(escapedJson);
```

**Output**:

```json
{"message":"He said, \"Hello, World!\" and then left."}
```

## What is JSON Unescape?

**JSON unescape** refers to the process of converting escaped characters in a JSON string back to their original form. This is important for correctly interpreting and displaying the data.

### Example of JSON Unescape

Consider the following escaped JSON string:

```json
{
  "message": "Hello, \"world\"!\nThis is a backslash: \\"
}
```

The unescaped version would look like this:

```json
{
  "message": "Hello, "world"!\nThis is a backslash: \"
}
```

## How to Unescape JSON

Just like escaping, most programming languages provide functions to unescape JSON. Here’s how you can do it in Python and JavaScript.

#### Python

In Python, you can use the `json` module to unescape characters:

```python
import json

escaped_json = '{"message": "Hello, \\"world\\"!\\nThis is a backslash: \\\\"}'
unescaped_json = json.loads(escaped_json)

print(unescaped_json)
```

#### JavaScript

In JavaScript, you can use the `JSON.parse` method:

```javascript
let escapedJson = '{"message": "Hello, \\"world\\"!\\nThis is a backslash: \\\\"}';
let unescapedJson = JSON.parse(escapedJson);

console.log(unescapedJson);
```

## Conclusion

JSON escape and unescape are processes that ensure JSON data is correctly interpreted and transmitted. Escaping converts special characters into their escaped forms to prevent parsing errors, while unescaping converts them back to their original forms for accurate data representation.
