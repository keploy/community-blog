To evaluate our software application's quality and reliability we are going to have to test our application in a variety of ways. The two most basic forms of testing we have available to us are unit testing and functional testing. Unit testing and functional testing are the TRUE basic building blocks of those different types of testing. All types of testing can verify behavior of software, but are at different levels, with different focuses, and it is important you understand the differences to deliver a bug-free application.

In this blog post we will cover some of the technical important differences between unit testing and functional testing. We will clearly describe what unit testing and functional testing can do, how you can perform each type of testing, and how each kind of testing fits into the big all encompassing testing spectrum.

# [**What is Unit Testing**](https://keploy.io/blog/community/what-is-unit-testing)**?**

![unit testing](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1749462891519/d4528103-dd64-466d-98b6-d85c3cf90199.png align="center")

Unit testing is the process of testing the current minimum functional unit of code. That is unit testing is performing testing on the software in such a way that we isolate the individual components of the program or units of code, and test them to ensure they function correctly and as intended in isolation.

Unit testing is the **smallest**, most **elemental** unit of the testing **lifecycle**. **Therefore**, unit testing **will be** more **sharply honed** to the **lowest level** testable **elements** of an application, **like** functions, methods, and classes. In unit testing you **will** run small **tests** **that** **test** **only** **the** expected behavior and results **of the isolated, testable unit**.

Unit Testing is a development approach **where** individual units **of code** are isolated and tested to **track down** bugs as early **as** **possible** **during** **then** **development** **lifecycle** and to create a **reasonable,** **maintainable** codebase.

## Unit **testing** **can** **be** **characterized**:

* **Level:** Low-level testing, **generally** **carried out** by developers.
    
* **Environment:** Generally **intends to run** in a controlled, isolated environment **and** **mock** **the** **system,** **in order** to isolate the unit from **it's** dependencies.
    
* **Speed:** **Unit tests are generally** very quick to execute **\-** given **the** small **amount of code they run over,** and **element of** isolation.
    
* **Feedback:** **Unit tests provide** fast feedback to **the developer** about **a** **problem occurring** in a specific area of code.
    
* Tools: Frameworks **like** JUnit (**for** Java), NUnit (**for** .**Net**), pytest (**for** Python), Jest (**for** JavaScript)**,** etc.
    

# [What is Functional Testing](https://keploy.io/blog/community/functional-testing-an-in-depth-overview)?

![functional testing](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1747335826128/18079054-3d7e-4a0b-a7ce-83a5ce69d4d9.jpeg align="center")

Functional Testing is a testing **process** to **confirm** a system or application **does** **what it is** intended **to do,** by testing functionality against **the defined** expected requirements. Functional testing **shifts** **focus** **from** the **individual units** as a whole, **when** **the** **system is operational and** it **is known the code and system provided to user** meets what the user expects

**Functional** **testing** **is focused on creating** a **set** of test cases with known input conditions and comparing **their** **operation** **outcomes** **to** expected **outcomes.** **Functional** testing **detects** defects that **could** **go** **undiscovered** **throughout the application process, which may have been unplanned or even overlooked** during development.

**Functional** **testing** does not **evaluate** the internal code structure or implementation **faults.** **As** **a** **means** **of** **validating** **the behavior of the** system **compared** **to** **the** **user’s point of view, it is more appropriate when considering** correctness **of the system**.

## **Some** **of the features** of **functional** **testing are**:

* **Level:** High-level testing **which is** often **conducted** by **a test professional** or QA **engineer**.
    
* **Environment:** **Typical functional testing will be** performed in an environment that closely resembles the production environment.
    
* **Speed:** **Functional tests may** be **far** slower than unit tests, **as** **they** **take a** larger **view of the system** and **can depend on** interaction with **other** **parts** **of the system**.
    
* **Feedback:** **Functional tests provide** feedback **as to** whether the application meets the needs **of the user** and **specification**.
    
* **Tools:** **The** **typical tools used are** Selenium, Cypress, Playwright for Automated Browser [UI Testing](https://keploy.io/blog/community/continuous-ui-testing-pipeline-browserstack-with-github-actions); Postman for Web APIs.
    
    **There** **is** **also** **Keploy**, **which** is an Enterprise grade API Testing Application used Automated Web API testing. **It uses** AI **to create** test-cases, and mocks **that** **are** **perfect** for **use with** large scale applications.

# Different Scopes

### **Scopes of Unit Testing**

* Focuses on testing units, components, functions, or methods in isolation
    
* **Verifying that** each unit **runs** as expected **with** **dependency** on **no** other modules.
    
* Aids in detecting bugs early in the development period, thus aiding debugging and code maintenance.
    
* Think of unit testing as often being performed by developers with automated test frameworks.
    
* Unit testing usually has a white-box testing approach, to proving code correctness in detail.
    
* Also helps with refactoring, because you are guaranteed that the code does not break anything on the original unit test.
    
* Ideally, the unit test is fast and can be executed before or with every change to make it harder to break anything.
    

### **Scopes of Functional Testing**

* Asserts functional overall behavior of a system per certain requirements.
    
* Makes sure a user is performing the workflow tasks, is interacting with the system as expected, is accessing and using data as expected, and is integrating responses with other systems and workflows seamlessly, as expected!
    
* Mostly black-box testing, as you do not care how the inner layers of the code are working, you expect behaviors based on your specifications.
    
* Functional testing is usually performed by testers in different aspects of the application testing process.
    
* Functional testing makes sure what the software is doing aligns with user and business expectations.
    
* Functional testing would identify defects in system behavior that could be missed in the unit tests.
    

# Steps Involved

### **Steps Involved in Unit Testing**

![Steps involved in a Unit Testing process](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1747304266894/774b1c19-26d8-4ac0-9538-fcf7246a8fc8.png align="center")

* **Define Test Cases:** Identifying the parts you want to test (function, method, or class).
    
* **Set Up Test Environment:** Set any necessary dependencies, mocks, or stubs to isolate the unit.
    
* **Write Test Code:** Use a unit test-type framework (for example, JUnit, pytest, NUnit) to implement your test cases.
    
* **Execute Tests:** Execute the test cases to see if the function performs as expected.
    
* **Analyze Results:** Compare the actual responses from the unit test to the expected responses to determine failures.
    
* **Debug and Resolve Issues:** If a test fails, **determine** **why** **it failed,** and **update** the code accordingly.
    
* **Re-run Tests:** **Run** tests again to **ensure** that **the** **updates did** not introduce new issues.
    
* **Automate Testing:** **Incorporate** unit tests into CI/CD pipelines **so** **that** **tests are always run**.
    

### **Steps Involved in Functional Testing**

![Steps involved in a Functional Testing process](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1747304386312/c3fd92d5-5590-4260-85ea-8be44a259a24.png align="center")

* **Identify Test Scenarios:** **Identify** test cases based on functional **specifications** and user expectations.
    
* **Prepare Test Data:** **Configure** **what** input values **or** configurations **would** **be needed to test**.
    
* **Prepare** **the** Test Environment: **Make sure that** the application is **either** **deployed** **or** ready **to be tested**.
    
* **Execute Test Cases:** **Tests** **can be carried out** manually, or **with the use of** automation **technologies** (**like** Selenium **or** Cypress).
    
* **Verify Outputs:** **Where** **there is matching expected output from the** system **in comparison** with **actual** **output of the system**.
    
* **Document Defects:** **Each** **difference** **in** **output** **produced** **must** **be** **logged for follow-up**.
    
* **Fix and Retest:** Developers **will** **fix** **logged defects,** testers **will** run **up the** tests **again** to **verify** **that the defect was fixed**.
    
* **Make** **sure** **to include migration testing:** **Confirm** **that the** changes **made** do not break existing functionality.
    

# Key Differences

| Aspect | Unit Testing | Functional Testing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **What** **is** **it used for?** | **To validate a function**/**class** | **To** **validate** business features **from start to** **end** |
| Type **of test** | White-box testing | Black-box testing |
| Tools **used** | JUnit, pytest, Mocha, Catch2 | Selenium, Cypress, Postman, Playwright |
| **Speed** | Fast (runs in milliseconds) | Slower (can take seconds or minutes) |
| **Environment** | **Pure**, no external systems | **Needs** integrated systems, databases |
| **What** **causes a failure** | Logic **Error** in code | Requirement mismatch, integration issues |
| **Who Writes It** | Developers | QA Engineers, SDETs, Test Automation Engineers |

# Tooling Examples

**Example 1: -** Unit Test - Java with JUnit

```java
@Test
public void testAdd() {
    Calculator calc = new Calculator();
    assertEquals(5, calc.add(2, 3));
}
```

**Example 2: -** Functional Test – Python with Selenium

```python
from selenium import webdriver

driver = webdriver.Chrome()
driver.get("http://example.com/login")
driver.find_element_by_id("username").send_keys("admin")
driver.find_element_by_id("password").send_keys("password")
driver.find_element_by_id("submit").click()
assert "Dashboard" in driver.page_source
driver.quit()
```

**Example 3: -** Unit Test – Python with Pytest

```python
import pytest
from calculator import add

def test_add():
    assert add(2, 3) == 5

if __name__ == "__main__":
    pytest.main()
```

**Example 4: -** Functional Test – Express.js Endpoints in TypeScript using Jest

```typescript
import request from "supertest";
import app from "../src/app"; // Express application instance

describe("GET /users", () => {
    it("should return a list of users", async () => {
        const response = await request(app).get("/users");
        expect(response.status).toBe(200);
        expect(response.body).toBeInstanceOf(Array);
    });
});
```

# **Recommended** Practices

#### **Regarding** Unit Testing:

* **Stick to** the AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert,
    
* **Utilize MR** **(mocking frameworks)** to **help** isolate dependencies (e.g. Mockito),
    
* Keep **deterministic** tests **\-** no external I/O or random values **are required**,
    

#### **Regarding** Functional Testing:

* Automate **procedures** with realistic data and user flows,
    
* **Base** tests around acceptance criteria,
    
* Maintain **integrity of** test data **with** seed scripts or fixtures.
    

# Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Unit Testing | Functional Testing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Over-mocking | Can lead to brittle tests | Rare, but possible when mocking APIs |
| **Not including** edge cases | If test coverage is **thin** | If user flows are not exhaustive |
| Fragile tests | **Because** **of** changing internal logic | **Because of changes** to UI or DOM structure |

# When You Should Use What

| Scenario | Test Type **Preferred** |
| --- | --- |
| Refactoring code internals | Unit Testing |
| Verifying API request-response cycle | Functional Testing |
| Testing mathematical logic or algorithms | Unit Testing |
| **Testing** a login process | Functional Testing |
| **Testing** all branches **of decisions** | Unit Testing |
| Testing UI to database **workflow** | Functional Testing |

# Complementary Nature

It **is** not **Unit** **vs** **Functional, both** Unit **tests** **and** **Functional** **tests** are **part** **of** a **complete** **testing** strategy **and** **both** **are required. Thinking** unit tests **would** give **you** **peace** of **mind** if integration **brakes is dangerous**.

**Similarly**, **trusting** only functional tests **will result in** slower feedback loops & **more** work **to** **maintain**.

**A balanced approach always helps.**

# Automate Tedious Testing Tasks with Keploy

Software testing is **an** **important** **job**, but unit **tests** and functional **tests are** often **time-consuming,** **requiring a lot of** manual **labor**. **For** **unit tests, you have to** write **the** **tests** for **every** **component of the application; for functional tests you have to** simulate **every** user **interaction** and **then check to make sure the output matched the** expected **output. It would be so simple if we could just have the computer do** all **that,** **but** **it** **was** **often tedious to write the tests**, **test again with another user interaction**, and **stumble through all the manual labor** to **make** **the** **computer** **obey to check for** quality while **also** **trying** **to** **keep** **pace** **with** **the** **development**, **or** **else** **don't** **rely** **entirely** **on** **unit** **tests**.

![Keploy logo](https://keploy.io/docs/img/keploy-logo-dark.svg align="center")

**With** **the** **older test** tools like Karate & RestAssured, **you** **have** **to go through the manual effort of the testing phase by** writing **the** test cases, Keploy **eliminates** **all** **manual** **effort** by **automatically** generating **the** test cases from **the** real API traffic **you already created**. **In** **addition** **to** **enhancements** **in** accuracy, **you** **can** **mock** **your** dependencies **like** **your** databases **or** external APIs, **which** **means** **you** **never** **have to touch any manual efforts at all**.

**By** **capturing** real user interactions with **your** APIs and **re-running** **your APIs** in **their** **pre-production environment**, **you** **can ensure your** code **and** **the associated APIs will not regress and** break **functional** **capabilities**. By **capturing API** regressions **prior** **to** **going into** production, **you** **can** **ensure you protect and** maintain **the** software integrity without **the** manual **labor**.

**I** **cannot end this statement without** re stating **Keploy** **saves** **you** **manual** **labor** **and productivity** for unit testing, integration testing, and API testing **and** **guarantees** **a** **smarter** **development** **process.**

## **How Keploy Simplifies Unit Testing**

Keploy **makes** unit testing **easy** by **generating** test **cases** **automatically** **to** **take stress off human** effort and **give** **the developer better** coverage. **Keploy’s** AI Unit Test Generator (UT Gen) dynamically **generates** and validates **unit** **tests.** **Developers** **write** **quality** **code** **that** **meets** **the** **requirements** instead of **spending** **time** **on** **test** **case** **creation, and** coverage **is ensured** without **the** **need** **to** **be a strong coder**.

![Keploy Quality Unit Tests](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1750750829118/e94e2b8a-31f0-4b14-b3e0-cff10884f09a.png align="center")

To enhance the developer experience even more, Keploy has a VS Code Extension that brings its test generation capability straight into Tthe developed tool. The extension enhances the developer experience by generating, viewing and running test cases without leaving the development environment and mindfulness, removing context switching, and enabling a smoother feedback loop. It will be especially handy when developers want to get a quick visualization of the generated tests, and make small changes within the code editor.

**In also a PR Agent that will autodetect PRs and Generate and validate tests automatically. When the developer raises a pull request, the PR agent activates to auto-generate test cases for the developer's new code, learn existing coverage gaps, and comment inline with suggestions or warnings. This ensures no code is merged without any appropriate coverage without imposing and asking the reviewer to "manually" enforce coverage**.

![Keploy UTG architecture](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1750750907030/02742cb4-460c-4f10-b7ed-0c5ef857e778.png align="center")

Keploy even comes equipped with error analysis reducing the time developers spend finding issues, and helps promoting an overall acceptance testing approach, as well as maintaining confidence in the quality of code being produced.

## **How Keploy Automates Functional Testing**

Keploy **takes the challenge of** functional testing **a step further,** by capturing real API traffic and generating test cases **automatically** **as** **it** **does** **so**. It **does** **this** **by** **capturing** **the request made to the API**, **and the** **response - including the request and response traffic to any external dependencies.** **When** **needed** **replaying** **the** **request** **is the final act in action, or validating that the** behavior **of** the **application** **follows what was** expected **and** without **the** **involvement of a person**.

**Keploy provides** automatic dependency mocking **so** **you can be** testing in **isolation**, **and will reduce your** reliance on live services.

**Keploy's** noise detection **will** **determine** **noise in determining the response as** non-deterministic, **filtering** **unnecessary** **subsequent** **traffic** **to present you with the possible tests you can functionally validate accurately**, **deploying you ready to create quality** tests **without** **the** **limitations of traditional test case generation by polling all through manual design**.

# **Conclusion**

Unit **Testing** and **Functional** **Testing** aren’t **competitors** - they're **collaborators** in **creating** **quality** software. **They** **have** a **different** role in your CI/CD pipeline **and enable** you **to** ship cleaner **and** more **reliable** code.

**Think** **about** writing **fast**, reliable unit tests for **the** logic and **behavior of your root code, and well-though-out** functional tests that **replicate** real user **behavior**. **This** way you're not writing code - you’re **producing** confidence.

# FAQ

### Is Unit Testing only for developers?

Mostly. Unit testing is **performed** by developers since it **tests** the internal **design and** logic **of** **the code**. **However,** testers **who are familiar** with programming can also **create helpful unit tests**.

### **Can Functional Testing catch bugs missed by Unit Tests?**

Absolutely. Functional testing checks end-to-end behavior, so it can catch integration issues, broken workflows, or user experience bugs that unit tests miss.

### **Is Unit Testing faster than Functional Testing?**

Yes! Unit tests run in milliseconds because they test isolated code. Functional tests deal with full systems or UIs, so they naturally take longer.

### **Should I use both Unit and Functional tests in my project?**

Definitely. They complement each other. Unit tests give fast, early feedback. Functional tests ensure the app works as a whole. Use both for a complete test strategy.

### **Do Functional Tests require knowledge of the codebase?**

Nope! **Functional** **testing** **is** **a** black-box **approach,** **so** **only** **learn** the expected behavior. You won't need to **dive** into the logic and/or source code.

### **Can I automate Functional Tests too?**

**Sure**! **Automated Functional Testing tools,** like Selenium, Cypress, Playwright and Postman, are **great choices** for automating tests **\-** especially for UIs and APIs.

### **Does Keploy require me to manually write test cases?**

**Definitely not**! Keploy generates test cases **automatically** from real API traffic, reducing manual effort. **Plus, it** even mocks external dependencies, like databases.

### **What if I only write Unit Tests? Is that enough?**

Not really. Unit tests can't catch issues **that** **arise** **from** **miscommunication** **between** **components**. **If you don't have** functional testing, **they** **can** **ship you a** broken user **flow**.

### **Can Functional Tests be flaky?**

**Definitely**, especially UI tests. They can **fail** **for** **a lot of reasons:** DOM changes, timing issues, **random** network delays, you name it. **This** **is** **why** stability **for your tests** and **ensuring** proper setup **is** **critical**.

### **How do I decide whether to write a Unit or a Functional Test?**

**As simple** rule: if you **are** testing **any sort of** logic inside a function, **you would** write a unit test. If you\*\*’\*\*re testing a user or system **using** the app, **you will** write a functional test.
