React Hooks changed the way we compose components, but testing them can be a mess—especially if you're using asynchronous data, having side effects that require cleanup logic, or need to check dependencies from React Context. The react-hooks-testing-library (deprecated now in favor of <mark>@testing-library/react</mark>) solves all of these problems, allowing developers to test hooks in isolation, configured for specific behavior.

In this tutorial we are going to see how to test custom React Hooks well using the Testing Library, explore Jest vs Vitest frameworks, and covering those parts omitted by other tutorials—such as error conditions, cleanup testing, and [TypeScript](https://keploy.io/blog/community/typescript-interface-complete-guide-for-modern-developers) support.

## Why Test React Hooks?

![Test React Hooks](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1752562188153/06413360-749d-4985-8d82-e046d42e03dc.png align="center")

Custom hooks encapsulate logic. If that logic is broken, your component tree can suffer. Unit testing hooks makes sure of the following:

* Business logic is decoupled from your app and is trustworthy
    
* Async actions like fetches or debouncing inputs are working as desired
    
* If you have effects and cleanups they are triggered appropriately
    

By testing your hooks, you can validate your assumptions and separate the behavior you expect, and catch any bugs before they affect the user experience.

### Migration Notice: From `react-hooks-testing-library` to `@testing-library/react`

If you're using React 18+, you should use the `renderHook` utility directly from `@testing-library/react`. The original `react-hooks-testing-library` is now archived and deprecated.

**Install:**

```bash
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react
```

Import like so:

```js
import { renderHook } from '@testing-library/react'
```

For older React versions, the [react-hooks-testing-library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-hooks-testing-library) package is still available but not recommended.

### Getting Started: Core API

```js
import { act, renderHook } from '@testing-library/react';

const useCounter = (initialCount = 0) => {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(initialCount);
  const increment = () => setCount(count => count + 1);
  return {
    count,
    increment,
  };
};

// test
const { result } = renderHook(() => useCounter());

act(() => {
  result.current.increment();
});

expect(result.current.count).toBe(1);
```

**Key API methods:**

* `renderHook(fn)` – run your hook function
    
* `result.current` – contains returned values
    
* `act(cb)` – wrap all state updates inside this
    
* `rerender(newProps)` – useful for prop-driven hooks
    
* `unmount()` – test cleanup logic
    

### Async Hooks + API Mocking

Let’s say your hook fetches data on mount:

```js
function useUser(userId) {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null)
  useEffect(() => {
    fetch(`/api/user/${userId}`)
      .then((res) => res.json())
      .then(setUser)
  }, [userId])
  return user
}
```

**Test it:**

```js
import { waitFor } from '@testing-library/react'
global.fetch = jest.fn(() => Promise.resolve({
  json: () => Promise.resolve({ name: 'Alice' })
}))

const { result } = renderHook(() => useUser(1))

await waitFor(() => expect(result.current).toEqual({ name: 'Alice' }))
```

**Tips:**

* Use `waitFor` to wait for async state
    
* Mock `fetch` or external libs (`axios`, etc.)

### Testing Errors in React 18

If your hook throws, Testing Library exposes `result.error`:

```js
function useThrowingHook() {
  throw new Error('Oops')
}

const { result } = renderHook(() => useThrowingHook())
expect(result.error).toEqual(new Error('Oops'))
```

This is especially useful for guards, failed API calls, or invalid config inputs.

For structured test strategies, read [How to Create Effective Test Cases](https://keploy.io/blog/community/getting-started-with-microservices-testing).

### Cleanup & Effects Testing

Hooks with side effects often use `useEffect` and need to clean up properly. To test this:

```js
function useInterval(callback, delay) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(callback, delay)
    return () => clearInterval(id)
  }, [callback, delay])
}

const clearIntervalSpy = jest.spyOn(global, 'clearInterval')
const { unmount } = renderHook(() => useInterval(() => {}, 1000))
unmount()
expect(clearIntervalSpy).toHaveBeenCalled()
```

### Jest vs Vitest: Which to Use?

**Jest**:

* Industry standard, widely supported
    
* Slower with large projects
    

**Vitest**:

* Vite-native, much faster
    
* Native ESM support
    
* Requires JSDOM setup for hooks
    

```ts
// vite.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    environment: 'jsdom',
  },
})
```

Choose based on project needs. Vitest is ideal for speed and modern setups.

### TypeScript Support

Testing Library supports TypeScript seamlessly:

```ts
function useTyped(input: number): string {
  return `Value: ${input}`
}

const { result } = renderHook(() => useTyped(5))
expect(result.current).toBe('Value: 5')
```

Typing `result` helps with better IDE support and test accuracy.

### Best Practices & Common Pitfalls

| **Do’s** | **Don’t** |
| --- | --- |
| Focus on behavior **instead of** implementation | Don't **directly** test internal state updates |
| **Properly mock** external APIs | Don't skip cleanup testing |
| Use act for all state changes | Don't **combine** concerns (test logic, not rendering) |

## Final Thoughts

Testing custom hooks is essential for reliable React applications. By using Testing Library with Jest or Vitest—and covering areas like async logic, cleanup, and TypeScript—you’ll gain confidence in your logic and ship fewer bugs.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1\. What is `renderHook` used for?

It allows you to run and test a custom React Hook in isolation without rendering a full component.

### 2\. Should I use `@testing-library/react` or `react-hooks-testing-library`?

Use `@testing-library/react` for React 18+. The original library is deprecated.

### 3\. How do I test hooks with async logic?

Use `waitFor`, `jest.fn`, or `jest.spyOn` to mock async behavior and wait for expected changes.

### 4\. Can I use Vitest instead of Jest?

Yes. Vitest is a modern, faster alternative. Just ensure you're using `jsdom` for DOM support.

### 5\. How do I test hook errors?

Check `result.error` after rendering the hook. Works with React 18.
