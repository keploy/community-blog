Software development is a field that never stands still; whether it is new features, bug fixes, or performance improvements, whatever code you change has the potential to break the software functionality that currently exists.

To combat the risk of accentuating existing software functionality when making changes during software development cycles, companies often employ Software Regression Testing Services. [Regression testing](https://keploy.io/blog/community/regression-testing-an-introductory-guide) is a very specific service, which addresses the reliability and integrity of software throughout ongoing periods of continuous development.

This blog discusses the important aspects of regression testing services, its benefits, challenges, how we can achieve marginal gains through the use of tools like Keploy and how companies can identify the right service partner.

## What Are Software Regression Testing Services?

Software regression testing services are third-party testing services that seek to confirm recent changes to application code do not negatively affect the application's existing functionality. Regression testing services typically come from dedicated professional QA vendors, consultants, or [testing tools](https://keploy.io/blog/community/regression-testing-tools-rankings-2025), and are indispensable to organizations with little or no capacity for in-house testing.

![regression testing services](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1753980086185/03a14611-c505-447b-95a0-7270d54d4954.png align="center")

These often include:

* Design and maintenance of regression test cases
    
* Test execution automation
    
* [CI/CD pipeline integration](https://keploy.io/blog/community/how-cicd-is-changing-the-future-of-software-development)
    
* Defect reporting and defect tracking
    
* Simulated end-user environments
    
    Unlike one-off or in-house testing efforts, these services offer dedicated resources and professional experience to develop durable, reusable, and scalable regression test suites.
    

## Why Businesses Need Regression Testing Services

The interest in software regression testing services is increasing for many reasons:

* Faster Releases: Agile development practices and DevOps require organizations to release quickly and in a more frequent manner. Regression testing services provide a level of assurance that each release can maintain stability of previously working features.
    
* Scalability: With organizational growth comes applications with a growing footprint. As a result, human testing becomes burdensome. Regression testing services develop automation, which minimizes human intervention.
    
    ![why regression testing services](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1753981650979/f2ea1214-012c-4c95-ade2-385a8fab362d.png align="center")
    
* Quality Assurance: A dedicated regression testing service can usually identify "edge-case" bugs that internal teams usually never find.
    
* Resource Optimization : Regression testing services allows internal teams to work without spending time and resources on quality assurance, and continue to focus on core product planning and development.
    
* Minimize Downtime: The longer you wait to catch regressions, the height that risks of deploying buggy software to production. Jam together a regression testing plan, build it into a faster release cadence, and have your service assist in your release cadence and commitment at all levels in perpetuity.
    

## Benefits of Regression Testing Services

### Choosing a dedicated regression testing service provides a wide range of benefits:

![benefits of regression testing services](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1754023632107/55862b73-d97e-4bd5-ab95-61327fe97ae2.png align="center")

* **Expertise:** Access to skilled professionals who have tested using the framework specific to your domain.
    
* **Efficiency:** Reduced timeframes to complete testing and release new updates.
    
* [**Test Coverage**](https://keploy.io/blog/community/mastering-test-coverage-quality-over-quantity-in-software-testing)**:** Wider and deeper coverage provided by both automated and manual methods.
    
* **Risk Management:** Finding defects upfront greatly reduces the chance of production failure.
    
* **Focus:** Internal teams can focus on development and innovation, instead of maintenance testing.
    
* **Custom Solution:** Services can be crafted for the unique needs of each project.
    

## Manual vs. Automated Regression Testing

![manual vs automated testing](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1754024964371/e5579038-06a2-44bd-859d-403524aa6989.png align="center")

In manual regression testing, testers manually run test cases, which can be time-consuming and susceptible to mistakes. In automated regression testing, testers utilize tools and scripts or programming to automatically run test cases over and over, after the software has changed.

**The advantages of automated testing include:**

* **Quicker Execution:** The automated testing capabilities execute in parallel in various environments, so it can run much quicker.
    
* **Reusable Work:** Once you have setup the automated test cases, you can use the same tested cases again for future builds, it saves you time and work later.
    
* **Cost Savings:** While it might require an initial investment, automation ultimately reduces the ongoing costs involved in testing.
    
* **Seamless CI/CD Integration:** Automated regression tests fit well with continuous integration and deployment pipelines, making it easier to catch issues early in the development cycle.

## Regression Testing Challenges and Solutions

![regression testing challenges solutions](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1754055382752/f70a5e7c-9a02-4224-ba8b-b8b219219b16.png align="center")

## Challenges and Solutions:

1. **Increased Test Suite Size:**  
    As the software grows, the regression test suite can grow to be unmanageable in size, and execution times increase.  
    **Solution:**
    
    * Implement test case prioritization to run the tests with the highest risk first.
        
    * Make use of test suite optimization.
        
2. **High Maintenance Effort:**  
    When an application is changing frequently, maintaining the test scripts is overhead - the applications may be evolving, but the regression tests will remain the same.
    
    **Solution:**
    
    * Provide modular and reusable scripts when you are designing tests.
        
    * Use either keyword-driven testing or data-driven testing.
        
3. [**Flaky Tests**](https://keploy.io/blog/community/what-is-a-flaky-test)**:**  
    Flaky tests that pass or fail intermittently can create false positive or false negative results which decreases confidence in the validity of the test run's results.
    
    **Solution:**
    
    * Determine the causes of flakiness and fix the root causes (unstable locators, timing issues, etc.).
        
    * Look for stable locators and integrate wait strategies to allow the application to settle.
        
4. **Resource Constraints:**  
    With manual regression testing, there is a huge amount of human effort that is required, as well as time, which doesn't allow for short cycles.
    
    **Solution:**
    
    * Use tools for test automation.
        
    * Utilize a continuous integration and delivery pipeline for regression tests to gain continuous feedback.
        
5. **Limited Test Coverage:**  
    In a fast pace environment, it is hard to get thorough coverage on all scenarios, so there is an accompanying risk that critical defects are missed.
    
    **Solution:**
    
    * Use risk-based testing to identify the most critical scenarios for coverage.
        
    * Continuous inspection and updating of test cases to reflect changes to requirements.
        

## How Often Should Regression Testing Be Performed

![how often regression testing performed](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1754062744378/a6d93627-bb4b-474f-b61d-aea6d3366319.png align="center")

Compared to more traditional models of software development, it is more common to do regression testing more frequently in agile and DevOps models, for example:

* After every code change. Even a small change can break existing functionality.
    
* Before every release of the software. You want to be confident that newer updates do not affect older features.
    
* During continuous integration. It is better to find bugs early in the development pipeline rather than late when resources have been exhausted.
    
* As related to bug fixes. When a bug is fixed, you should consider that it may affect other functionality in the system.
    
* Testing frequently consistently is the best way to ensure high quality software and limiting production risk.
    

## How Do You Improve Regression Testing?

* Automate the boring stuff
    
* Make sure your test cases are always new and useful
    
* Add tests to your CI/CD pipeline
    
* Use version control to keep track of things
    
* Keep an eye on things like test time, pass rates, and defects
    
* Encourage developers and testers to collaborate
    

## **Main differences between manual regression testing and automated regression testing:**

| **Feature** | **Manual Regression Testing** | **Automated Regression Testing** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Execution Method** | Test cases are executed manually by testers. | Test cases are run automatically using software tools. |
| **Human Involvement** | High human involvement in executing and verifying tests. | low human involvement once automated tests are setup. |
| **Speed** | Execution is slow when performed manually. | Execution is much faster when automated; can be faster for large test suites. |
| **Efficiency** | prone to human error and the possibility of differing execution. | reliable and consistent execution once automated. |
| **Resource Requirement** | Manual requires significant human resources (testers). | Automated requires a large time investment initially but is less resource intensive going forward. |
| **Scalability** | Limited scalability for large test suites. | very scalable for large and complex applications. |
| **Repeatability** | Execution is contingent on tester skills and availability. | Tests can be reliably repeated again and again. |
| **Maintenance** | Tests may require updates regularly with changes and maintenance. | Tests require updates as software evolves but are easier to maintain. |

* **Code Coverage Analysis:** Keploy comes with built-in code coverage analysis tools or supports existing code coverage tools for automated regression testing such as line coverage, branch coverage and statement coverage. If you collect code coverage metrics while running regression tests, you will be able to ensure all applicable code paths were executed and any regression bugs discovered.
    

### Benefits of using regression testing with Keploy:

* It supports the assurance that the software is stable and dependable.
    
* It assists in preventing regressions, bugs that are added to software as changes are made.
    
* It helps to allow failures to happen in the software prior to exposing it to users.
    
* It helps save time and resources by not having to correct regressions after exposing software to end users.
    

Keploy facilitates regression testing through automated recording of real user API calls and converting them into test cases. When you make changes to your application (for example, when you release a new version), you can use Keploy to re-run or replay all of the recorded API interactions against the updated app. Keploy then compares the current responses to the responses that were previously captured to find any unintended changes or regressions. Keploy support for regression testing in these key areas:

* It captures and replays real API traffic, ensuring your tests reflect actual user scenarios.
    
* Keploy automatically mocks dependencies, so you don’t need to set up complex test environments for regression runs.
    
* With self-healing tests, Keploy can auto-update minor changes in API responses, reducing maintenance overhead.
    
* The flaky test detection feature validates your test results over multiple runs to ensure reliability.
    
* Keploy generates detailed reports highlighting any differences between expected and actual API responses, making it easy to spot regressions.
    

This approach increases test coverage, reduces manual effort, and ensures that new changes do not break existing functionality, making regression testing faster and more reliable.[**​**](https://keploy.io/docs/concepts/reference/glossary/regression-testing/#benefits-of-perform-regression-testing-using-keploy)
