To be honest, most Python developers are not using list comprehensions. Even I, who is writing this blog, never used list comprehensions before. But when I saw some examples, I felt I had to try and use them in my Python code. The reason for this change of mind is that there are a few advantages we get if we implement list comprehensions. Let’s see what these are in this blog today.

**Let’s start from the basics:**

## What is a List?

If you ask this question to an 11th-grade school student, they will answer what a list is. Basically, lists allow us to store multiple items in a single variable. Also, a list is a built-in dynamically sized array (it automatically grows and shrinks).

We can store all types of items.

* ```python
                my_list = [0, a, ['keploy', 'testing'], (2, 06, 2025), b]
                print(my_list)
    ```
    
    Lists are mutable in Python. This means you can replace, add or remove elements.
    
    ## How to create list in python??
    
    We have now refreshed our minds about what a list is. Next comes the main interesting topic: how to create a list in Python. Basically, there are two ways:
    
    ```python
    my_list = [1,2,3,4,5]
    ```
    
    And less preferable:
    
    ```python
    my_list = list()
    ```
    
    Basically the **list(obj)** is used to transform another sequence into the list.
    
    I never tried the second one we are all familiar with the first one, right? That’s how we have learned it, right?
    

Now let’s meet the hero of today’s blog.

## What is List Comprehension?

List comprehension is a concise way to create lists in Python. It lets you build a new list by applying an expression to each item in an existing list (or any iterable), all in a single line of code.

If you’re still not getting the point—basically, list comprehension allows you to create lists with less code. List comprehensions enhance code performance by being faster and more efficient than traditional for loops. They also improve code readability and conciseness, making your code easier to write and maintain.

Let’s look at the following example.

**Syntax of list comprehension:**

```python
[expression for item in iterable]
```

* **expression**: The value to put in the new list (often using `item`)
    
* **item**: Each element from the iterable (e.g., a list or range)
    
* **iterable**: Any object you can loop over
    

Basic Example:

### **Example 1: Creating a List of Squares**

Create a list of squares for numbers 1 to 5:

```python
squares = [x * x for x in range(1, 6)]
print(squares)
```

Guess the Output?

### **Example 2: Nested List Comprehension**

Create a 3x3 matrix (list of lists) with all values set to 0:

```python
matrix = [[0 for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]
print(matrix)
```

Guess the Output?

### **Example 3: Using If-Else in List Comprehension**

Create a list where each number from 1 to 5 is "even" or "odd":

```python
labels = ["even" if x % 2 == 0 else "odd" for x in range(1, 6)]
print(labels)
```

Guess the Output?

### **Example 4: List Comprehension with Functions**

Suppose you have a function that doubles a number. Use it in a list comprehension:

```python
def double(x):
    return x * 2

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
doubled = [double(x) for x in numbers]
print(doubled)
```

Guess the Output?

In the above cases, we saw how list comprehension helps us refactor code, making it easier and simpler to understand. I hope you don’t have any other doubts.

## Difference Between 'for' Loop vs. List Comprehension

Instead of just seeing and learning from a boring comparison table, we will see the difference in terms of code. We can see, discuss, and learn the differences—but before that, let’s assume the scenario:

**Scenario:**

**Suppose you have a list of numbers, and you want to make a new list containing the square of each even number, but only if it’s greater than 10.**

Let's use the list:

```python
numbers = [1, 4, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21]
```

Let’s implement this using FOR Loop:

```python
result = []
for n in numbers:
    if n % 2 == 0:         
        square = n * n
        if square > 10:    
            result.append(square)
print(result)
```

#### **Explanation:**

* You start with an empty list `result`.
    
* For every number in `numbers`:
    
    * Check if it’s even (`n % 2 == 0`).
        
    * If yes, square it.
        
    * Check if the square is greater than 10.
        
    * If both conditions are true, add the squared number to `result`.
        
    
    Let implement the same **Using List Comprehension**
    
    ```python
    result = [n * n for n in numbers if n % 2 == 0 and n * n > 10]
    print(result)
    ```
    
    #### **Explanation:**
    
    * All the logic is condensed into a single line.
        
    * The expression before for is what you want in your new list (n\*n).
        
    * The part after for ” describes what you’re iterating over (for n in numbers).
        
    * The if at the end combines both filtering conditions.
        

With the above two examples, you are able to see the exact difference between the two approaches, right? Then comes to interesting part when to use list comprehensions and the benefits of it.

## When to Use List Comprehensions in Python

* You need to create a new list by transforming or filtering items from another list (or any iterable).
    
* You want concise, readable code.
    

## Benefits of Using List Comprehensions

List comprehensions optimize list generation and help to avoid side effects such as gibberish variables. As a result, you get more concise and readable code. These are the things we have been seeing since the start of this blog.

The first advantage I would say is ease of code writing and reading. You don’t have to be an expert to learn and use lists the list comprehension allows you to write code that is easy to maintain.

Improved execution speed in most comparisons, you might have seen the first approach takes much more time as it needs to execute sequentially and do various steps. But if you see the list comprehension, it executes so fast.

No modification of existing lists. A list comprehension call creates a new list in Python without changing the existing one.

## Conclusion:

In today’s blog, we learned some really cool stuff, isn’t it? We also learned how to optimize our Python code by following list comprehensions, so then what are you waiting for? Grab your laptop and start playing with list comprehension.

## FAQs:

1. ### **How is a list comprehension different from a for loop?**
    

A list comprehension is more concise and typically more readable for simple operations, while a `for` loop can handle more complex logic and multiple steps.

2. ### **Can I use list comprehensions with functions?**
    

Yes! You can call a function inside the expression:

```python
def square(x): return x * x
squares = [square(x) for x in range(5)]
```

3. ### **Are list comprehensions faster than for loops?**
    

Usually yes, for simple transformations, because they are optimized internally in Python.

4. ### **What is the difference between list comprehensions and generator expressions?**
    

List comprehensions return a list immediately; generator expressions use parentheses and return a generator, which produces items one at a time (lazy evaluation).

```python
# List comprehension
lst = [x*x for x in range(5)]

# Generator expression
gen = (x*x for x in range(5))
```

5. ### **How can I avoid memory issues with very large lists?**
    

For huge datasets, use generator expressions instead of list comprehensions to save memory.
