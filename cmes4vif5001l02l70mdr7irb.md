Ever since AI tools came into the picture, it has transformed a lot of industries. An industry most evolved due to this revolution of AI is the software Development industry. There have been discussions about AI for coding being so good that it holds the potential to replace developers, which might be debating but precisely a false claim. In my opinion, as of 2025 AI for coding is just good enough to make the building blocks of the app but without a developer intervention it is no less than hours of debugging, debugging of the code that you have no context of, which eventually takes more time to understand and then debug.

Developers all over the the software development industry are using the [best ai tool](https://keploy.io/blog/community/top-5-ai-tools-in-2025-developer-should-must-try) for developers in order to increase their productivity, speed and quality.

##### **Personal Experience With Cursor:**

As I mentioned earlier, I have extensive hands-on experience with Cursor, standout AI for coding tools for developer productivity, over the last year. When Cursor first came out, and there was all the hype, it was like an inflection point. We didn't have many AI-powered IDEs at the time, and using such a robust AI coding assistant to develop things at a faster pace felt like a superpower, and it could save an incredible amount of time and energy on how we work.

![cursor chain of thoughts and context awareness](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1755777837128/17c12497-7c0e-4acb-8ff8-2031f321ad43.png align="center")

Even now that I have maxed out my chatting capacity for the free tier, its ability to interact intelligently with my whole codebase is still worth a lot to me. I can comfortably say it is one of the best AI dev tools on the market. For instance, as shown in the image, I had Cursor update some of the UI elements for me. It did it great in about 10-12 seconds- a fantastic example of competent AI doing frontend work.

![cursor models](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1755777910511/bbd7df3c-60e0-4916-9276-756a17b32ee0.png align="center")

One of the neatest features, especially for those who are very much exploring AI for coding free options, is the ability to pivot between different LLMs. Even with the free plan, if you run through the max of one model, you can pivot to another, which is a very nice level of flexibility.

#### **Verdict:**

Cursor provides a balance between legacy editors and AI developer tools. Cursor ecosystem creates a natural coding flow that yields productivity gains while preserving control for developers.

2. ### **Keploy**
    

Keploy made it to the list as our go to testing tool for multiple scenarios. The reason behind choosing Keploy? All the other testing tools that we tried not deterministic in nature. In other testing tools, I was not able to generate and use the script. But, with Keploy, since it is using AI for thinking of the edge cases and recording the test cases deterministically, hence it was not creating the edge cases just of rate sake of doing so like the other tools. I felt that this deterministic approach was very smart and stood out for me!

##### **My Personal Experience with Keploy:**

I wanted to see Keploy's AI-driven testing in action. I wanted to put two of its tools to the test with one of my own projects: the API Testing Platform with its the Unit Testing PR Agent and the API testing chrome extension (I wanted to try both the platform and the chrome extension and extension would eventually redirect me to the platform).

First, I installed the Keploy Chrome Extension and went to my web application. I thought it would be fast and easy, but it exceeded my expectations. I started my project and used it like I would as a normal user, and the extension was running in the background to capture any request made.

![keploy api testing platform](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1755782613915/bc8aa5bb-cdc8-4fbc-b9c0-73cde71e2794.png align="center")

It captured all API calls, and produced and recorded all cURL commands without my intervention. When I was finished, I stopped the capture and clicked "Generate Test Cases". Instantly, I was redirected to app.keploy.io, where a suite of API tests that were all relevant to my request were waiting to be run. Not only was this process fast but it was almost frictionless, and it transformed a tedious manual task to a simple two-click task.

Next, I tried the Unit Testing PR Agent. Once I installed it from the GitHub Marketplace onto a repository for an open-source project I contribute to, I made code changes and opened a pull request (PR).

Within seconds, the Keploy PR Agent left a comment on my PR, asking if I would like to generate unit tests for my changes. I clicked and it went to work. A few moments later, it left a second comment with a complete set of unit tests covering my changes. What surprised me most was that it included a detailed summary that contained a table with metrics for the new tests. It was fantastic! It practically felt like an automated future where necessary testing was turned into an integrated automaton of the code-review cycle instead of a separate code chore consuming extra time.

![keploy unit testing pr agent](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1755782765224/c42d2783-33db-435b-b3f3-ee68c4a9c4e1.png align="center")

#### **Verdict:**

Keploy's open-source integration testing impressed me the first time I tried it back in 2024, and I was curious to see what other tools Keploy offered. I recently put their new claimed platform through its paces, and I can honestly say that they have advanced significantly. The API Testing Chrome Extension is a total game-changer. It was so easy to convert a basic browsing session on my project into a complete API test suite. The Unit Testing PR Agent was also an easy fit into my GitHub workflow, and allowed me to generate relevant tests for a pull request with one click of confirmation. Although its unit testing is at its best with Go, there are improvements to be made in other languages, the platform overall is super impressive. Keploy has really come into its own as an AI-empowered, comprehensive suite that reduces the burden of testing considerably, and the paid tiers surely provide a return for the velocity and coverage it offers. This truly is a paradigmatic shift in how we develop.

##### **Personal Experience with Github Copilot:**

To be honest, I have been using Github copilot since a long time now, and i find it very handy since it comes inside the code editor that i use the most as well as it reviews my prs on github as well. To keep things fair I asked one of my teammates to share his experience on github copilot. He played around with GitHub Copilot to help him better understand a Go file, and he was pleasantly surprised with what he got back. Copilot gave him an exhaustive rundown of the file, explaining what it defined, the functions that were present, and even pointed out deficiencies and potential compile issues. It even asked whether he wished to fix them as part of the process, which made it feel like working with an active coding collaborator.

![github copilot review](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXd5u4E4EE-_uYZjcRDBxuifXF2W0R4n979nOhFVaq8i-D0L2oqP0ktOweZcATIH1SxqU3dCYMhuZo96q6DP_gPJ9i6VhBR4Ivn15hfqFoLS2k5MtYyP8GAwp_c5iKZvxSlqBGFUrg?key=3o65op-9ZLM6Mkb61I6ZjQ align="left")

Additionally, there was clarity in Copilot's discussion of each function, which gave him an added layer of confidence in his understanding. Beyond this, he also used it to review code and generate PR descriptions for an open source project, which streamlined and accelerated the workflow beyond what either of us expected.

#### **Verdict:**

GitHub Copilot endures as the gold standard in AI for coding, providing maximum bang-for-your-buck as an AI coding assistant. It precise contextual insights makes it a must-have tool for developers today looking for improvement in efficiency and accuracy.

##### **Personal Experience With Bolt:**

When I first heard about Bolt, a newer generative AI for coding tool for software development, my first thought was, "Wow, here we go again!" Bolt has received a lot of hype, and I really had to experience it for myself. So, I started with what I thought might be a cool experiment in its natural language to code capabilities. I asked it to create an application that could turn a user's LinkedIn profile and GitHub repositories into a portfolio website.

![bolt ai review](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1755777777174/7e53fbb6-7426-423a-92a5-d140ed0ec9d8.png align="center")

Upon completing the prompt process, the AI code generation process began, and took about three to four minutes to generate the codebase, edit and style for the UI, etc. The code produced a solid looking interface but much of the functionality was broken behind the scenes.

This experience showcased the benefit of AI for coding, being that it is great for creating boilerplate to cut down the initial dev time. However, it also pointed out the current limitations and dangers of AI in dev; the project needed lots of additional prompting and manual developer work. One could say tools like Bolt are acting more like AI pair programmers in this currently: assisting us and not replacing us, because human intervention is fundamentally needed.

#### **Verdict:**

Bolt breaks boundaries by redefining the use of AI for coding, by combining development, testing and deployment in one cohesive workflow. As a code generator AI & collaboration tool, it becomes indispensable for agile teams.

##### **Personal Experience with Gemini 2.5 pro:**

Gemini 2.5 pro was launched with a claim of being the best LLM for coding till it’s release. To be honest, it did the justice to the tag for a while until the new LLms showed up. The best thing about google gemini 2.5 pro was that it was a free tool for student, which actually says a lot about google and how they actually promote learning. Me, a final year computer science undergrad, had the privilege to claim it for free.

![google gemini 2.5 pro trial](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1755846702873/db2bbf72-b2d3-42f4-a094-0f651e5e1219.png align="center")

Ever since i got it, my experience with coding problems, iterations, improvements have been top notch. The best thing about gemini 2.5 pro is the chat length with no limits and a huge chain of thoughts and context window. Unlike claude sonnet 4, gemini 2.5 pro has a huge chat message size and chat window (I have talked about this problem with claude further in the blog).

To actually test and show it’s capabilites both in terms of coding and image to frontend,I gave it a simple prompt alongwith a screenshot asking it to replicate the same( I gave the same to gpt 5 and sonnet 4 too further in the blog). the results were quite fascinating, it only took 30 seconds to write the entire code, even gave me a preview in the chat itself. The final code with the desired output was very well written and easy to understand, it completed the task in very few lines of code following the best practices. Totally loved it!

Claude sonnet 4 is considered to be one of the best yet LLMS for coding alongwith chatgpt 5. The power of this tool is beyond simple coding tasks. There have been times when i used to get stuck at comp\[lex coding problems and my go to LLM for debugging used to be sonnet 4. For me personally it was good with complex coding tasks the only drawback was that everytime I was trying to look for better solutions and having a productive conversation, the chat limit would exceed and it would ask me to start a new chat all over again, which used to take a lot of time and effort in the free version.

![claude sonnet 4 review](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1755846155293/81a9ec2f-192f-4f67-8967-bafb15ea5859.png align="center")

To show it’s potential, I prompted it with the same prompt and image i gave to chatgpt 5, the same prompt, to test it’s frontend skills as well as image to website capabilities. The results did not disappoint me, then it captured the animations the same way gpt 5 did, it had the details and responsiveness as well. The only bottleneck here is that it would still require my manual intervention in order to have a perfectly ready landing page.

#### Verdict:

Claude Sonnet 4 shows that there is no need to sacrifice speed or intelligence when implementing AI coding.

It is also an amazing tool to create high quality front-end components, but its most significant advantage is being context-aware to work and modify existing UI libraries.

I had my "aha" moment when I witnessed libraries similar to Aceternity UI performing UI modifications using v0. I was very much inspired and wanted to explore what it could do for one of my own projects. I was mentally prepared, of course, for an extensive setup of v0, but what I actually encountered was an amazing developer experience. It took me 30-40 minutes to get everything set up, and I had completely integrated v0, and I was prepared for an end-user system for the developer productivity value, it is absolutely a beast.

![vercel v0 frontend](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1755845851138/88c06096-2a37-4d47-978a-c2cd7fd4ae23.png align="center")

The power of the tool in terms of day-to-day tomfoolery is equally impressive. I simply gave it an existing component and then subsequently asked for a few minor changes and also some new UI features. In less than two minutes, it returned to me the exact updated version, with speed and accuracy, that I had requested. Now I really liked it.

#### **Verdict:**

Vercel v0 is not just another AI code generator. The natural language UI generation and development pipeline will make it one of the most accessible and useful AI for coding tools for modern web developers.

##### **Personal Experience with Lovable:**

**The Potential of a Detailed Prompt:** A few months ago, my first experiment I did with a short, simple prompt didn't yield the best results. As I recognized that I needed to give the tool more context, I tried again with a very detailed prompt, including every single section and feature that I was hoping for on my website. It certainly took a lot longer to build, but ultimately the tool output a fully responsive and functional site. The quality was so good, in fact, that I was able to deploy the output directly on Lovable's own lovable.dev domain as a first version to share with others and get feedback about. That gave me the confidence to realize that Lovable could provide something actually useful with some thoughtful instructions.

![lovable ai frontend](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1755783846467/ddd11021-f13c-40b9-a80a-df1cb96ac1a6.png align="center")

**Second Attempt:** A Reminder about Speed vs. Quality More recently, I prompted Lovable to "create a modern SaaS landing page." It was generated in a crazy four minutes. Although maybe I was a bit too naive to think that it would create something clearly jaw droppingly good. I got a landing page, but it wasn't something I could ship. Much of it was broken, including issues with the fonts, headings, and animations. While it was clear that it generated a landing page, it was also equally clear that the site would require still require significant human intervention for debugging, and also design enhancements.

#### Verdict:

Lovable.dev bridges the gap between design and engineering using AI to code delightful quick clean UI code. I would definitely recommend for teams that need to get frontends into production format while still being able to stay in their design oasis. This is a decent example of a SaaS AI that delivers efficient and user-friendly applications that simplifies the whole development process from idea to production deploy. The only thing to keep in mind while working with lovable is to write detailed and explanatory prompts.

## The Future of AI in Software Development

The future of AI in software development is not a competition between humans and machines, it is a symbiotic relationship. The most successful teams will not be those that use AI well, but those that optimize for collaboration between the human developer and the AI.

A shift will occur where AI will serve as a hyper-productive assistant who can perform many of the boring, repetitive tasks that a developer spends a lot of time on. Humans will now be able to focus on higher-level functions like architectural design, solving unique problems creatively, and deciding strategy. Whereas the human developer will play a role of overseeing and directing AI, a conductor of a highly complex orchestra of automation tools.

This implies that we will reach levels of productivity and creativity we thought impossible. We will think of AI less as a tool to write code and more as a partner in every aspect of growth—from generating initial requirements and architectural diagrams, to automating testing and deployment. The ultimate outcome is that we will write AI-enabled code collectively. One more step on the path to building the complex, robust, and creative software that is the hallmark of all social progress.

## Conclusion

Whether provided by a language model coding tool like GitHub Copilot, or a niche tools like Keploy - AI is changing the way we think about software development. Using AI as a assistive crutch begins a new era of productivity, learning, and accessibility. AI has sped up coding to everyone, and made it more user-friendly. This changes the world, but will also put down challenges, concerning reliable use, licensing, risks, and even human oversight and intervention. The real utility of AI for software development will be in providing a useful way to co-create a partnership between people and AI. With this, a future of coding using AI could be where human creators and critical understanding are paired with the speed and ability of AI, to derive solutions for their field and a more productive industry overall.

## FAQs

### Is AI replacing developers?

I think this is an often-arising fear, but without consensus, AI will not replace people who writes code, it will change the way there are people called developers. With AI, code and coding changes; but it does not replace humans in a development role. AI technologies and products will take up the more repetitious and boring parts of coding, so a human can be thought of for the more meaningful or important aspects of problem-solving, intentional design decisions, and high value thinking.

### How dependable is AI coded software?

Dependability of AI generated code differs greatly. Though an AI code generator is generally able to write syntactically correct code, there are chances it has bugs, security issues, or does not meet requirements. Human review and oversight is still necessary to guarantee the dependability and quality of code.

### What is the biggest risk **in** using AI in coding?

One of the biggest risks is depending on AI too much. When software developers lean too heavily on AI as coding assistance, they risk losing fundamental skills needed to write code. It is important to use these tools as an assistant, not a crutch.

### What is the difference between an LLM for coding and a traditional code generator ai?

An LLM for coding is a large language model that is specifically trained on code and is able to understand and generate code, often in a conversational way. A traditional code generator ai, the term is a broader term and may vary greatly, that describes any ai that automates writing code, not necessarily powered by large language models.
