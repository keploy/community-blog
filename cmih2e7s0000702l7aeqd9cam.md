Do you find yourself questioning why popular apps sometimes crash or act unusually? Regardless of how hard software is crafted, bugs are a huge obstacle for teams, often resulting in unhappy users, lost revenue, or even product release delays. Most organizations are unable to track these bugs effectively and so they often use a mix of spreadsheets, or scattered scribbled notes and lose them in the shuffle—causing confusion, repeated work, and issues that aren’t resolved. This is a great place to bring in a bug tracking tool because bug tracking is essentially a centralized, organized way to log, track, and resolve bugs.

With the right bug tracking system, your team can build quality products and shorten cycles of development and testing. In this blog, we are going to look at what bug tracking tools are, why every team should have one, what to look for in a bug tracking tool, and how tools like Keploy can help make bugs smarter and faster to manage. We’ll also touch on how modern [software quality assurance services](https://keploy.io/blog/community/software-quality-assurance-services) complement these tools to strengthen overall product reliability. You will walk away with a solid understanding of how the right bug tracker tool can change the way you code.

## Understanding Bug Tracking Tools

A bug tracking tool is a software application to detect, log, manage, and track defects in the process of software development. Rather than informal methods, a bug tracking tool creates a central location for teams to work together to prioritize bugs while documenting defect history.

State of the art bug tracking tools give teams the ability to document a high level of detail about the defect including severity, steps to reproduce the defect, screen shots, and status updates. This framework promotes tracking work and assures bugs do not get lost in the process of development.

## Key Features of Bug Tracking Tools

**Several** **components** **should** **be** **considered** **while** **assessing** **bug** **tracking** **tools** **including** **but** **not** **limited** **to** **the** **following**:

* **Issue Entering and Categorization:** In addition to allowing teams to create new issues within the application, the tracker will allow for categorizing the issues as needs based on their severity (blocker, major, and minor) or their category/component (e.g., Database).
    
* **Collaboration Tools:** A good tracking tool allows developers, testers, and stakeholders to collaborate and communicate with each other on bugs through this tool.
    
* **Reporting and Analytics**: Provides insights into frequently occurring bugs, team velocity, and project health-related trends.
    
* **Integration Capabilities**: Works well with project management tools, version control tools, and CI/CD tools.
    
* **Custom Workflows**: Supports different development methodologies and organizations, whether they follow SDLC or use Agile, Scrum, and Kanban.
    

Integrating all these features means that bug tracking tools can make the debugging experience simpler, while also improving productivity as a whole.

### Benefits of Bug Tracking Tools

Using a clear and organized bug tracker tool is not just helpful for managing bugs—you will have more benefits. Here are some of the benefits:

**1\. Improved Team Collaboration**

Using one bug-tracking system helps developers, QA engineers, product managers, and [QA automation](https://keploy.io/blog/community/qa-automation-revolutionizing-software-testing) specialists stay on the same page. With a central bug tracker, there's less confusion because everyone can see updates in real time, instead of relying on scattered emails or spreadsheets.

**2\. Increased Accountability**

When it tracks things like assignment and status, teams will know exactly who is responsible for fixing what bugs, which removes somewhat eliminates delays of fixes, as well as increased accountability from the whole team.

**3\. Prioritization of Critical Issues**

Not all bugs are equal. Bug trackers will allow teams to prioritize bugs based on the impact and severity of the issue to ensure that they are dealing with the critical bugs first.

**4\. Insights Based on Data**

Analytic features generate insights about software quality trends (notable bug patterns, recurring mistakes, and the velocity of the team). These insights support managers making data-driven decisions about potential improvements for products.

**5\. Shorter Release Cycles**

When bugs are being tracked and resolved in an efficient manner, development team can keep release cycles shorter while still maintaining quality. In Agile and DevOps this becomes an important metric.
