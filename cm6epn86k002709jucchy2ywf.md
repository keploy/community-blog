One of the fundamental skills every developer should have is good project cloning from [GitHub](https://github.com/keploy/keploy.git). Whether it's working on a great open-source project, or cloning a repository to their local machine, being able to **clone a project from GitHub using HTTPS** is very essential. 

In this complete guide, we will take you step-by-step through both the technical details of cloning repositories, answering questions, and explaining the advantages of using HTTPS for cloning. 

## **What Is Git Cloning?**

The cloning procedure is copying a remote repository from a GitHub project to your local machine. This enables code development and modification locally and pushing the changes back to GitHub.

It is, by definition, an essential feature of a version control system, which allows developers to have an exact copy of the project with its history and branches. Cloning using **git clone with https** is another popular method because it is simple, safe, and does not involve SSH key configurations. 

## **Why Use HTTPS to Clone a Repository?**

While there are multiple ways to clone a repository (such as using SSH), cloning with HTTPS has its advantages, especially for beginners:

1. **No SSH Key Setup**: Using HTTPS doesn’t require you to set up SSH keys, making it easier for new users.
    
2. **Secure Communication**: HTTPS ensures that your data is securely transmitted, preventing data theft or tampering.
    
3. **Easy Access**: With HTTPS, you can clone repositories easily from any device with an internet connection, without requiring special permissions or keys.
    

Given all the above reasons, cloning a repository via HTTPS is almost always preferred by those who don't want to work through SSH keys.

## **Step-by-Step Guide: How to Clone a Project from GitHub Using HTTPS**

Cloning a project from Github using HTTPS is simple. I shall give you the screenshot stepwise detailed guide.

### **Step 1: Find the Repository to Clone**

1. Go to the GitHub repository you want to clone. For instance, let’s say you want to clone a repository called awesome-project.
    
2. On the repository page, look for the green **Code** button located above the files list. Click on it to reveal the cloning options.
    
3. Select the **HTTPS** option. It will generate a URL like this:  
    https://github.com/username/awesome-project.git  
    This is the URL you'll use in the cloning process.
    

### **Step 2: Clone the Repository Using Git**

You got the HTTPS URL, now let's clone the repository with Git.

1. Open your terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or any terminal that you prefer).
    
2. Then, navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
    

Type the following command:  
  
git clone https://github.com/username/awesome-project.git

3. Hit Enter, and Git will begin cloning the repository to your local machine. The cloning process may take a few moments depending on the size of the repository.
    

### **Step 3: Authenticate if Necessary**

If you are cloning a private repository, you may be asked for authentication.

1. **GitHub Username**: Enter your GitHub username.
    
2. **Personal Access Token (PAT)**: GitHub no longer accepts password authentication for HTTPS. Instead, you’ll need to use a **Personal Access Token (PAT)**, which is a secure way to authenticate.
    
    * To generate a PAT, go to GitHub → **Settings** → **Developer settings** → **Personal access tokens** → **Generate new token**.
        

### **Step 4: Start Working on the Cloned Repository**

Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the project folder and start working with the code. You can edit files, create branches, and commit changes just as you would in any local Git repository.

For example, you can change the directory to the cloned repository:

## cd awesome-project

## **Git Clone with HTTPS: Common Issues and Solutions**

Even though **git clone https** is straightforward, some users face challenges. Here are common issues and their solutions:

* **Authentication Failures**: If you see an error about authentication failure, ensure you’re using a Personal Access Token (PAT) instead of a password.
    
* **Repository Not Found**: Double-check the repository URL and ensure it’s correct. If it’s a private repo, ensure that you have permission to access it.
    
* **SSL Errors**: In some cases, SSL errors can occur. This may happen due to network issues or outdated SSL certificates. Make sure your Git version is up to date.
    

## **Cloning a Repository from GitHub Using HTTPS vs SSH**

One common question that arises is: **“What’s the difference between cloning a repository using HTTPS and SSH?”**

Here’s a quick comparison:

In general, **HTTPS** is a good choice for new users or occasional contributors, while **SSH** is preferred by experienced developers who work on GitHub regularly.

## **How to Clone a Repo with HTTPS in Different Environments**

Regardless of whether you're using Windows, Mac, or Linux, the **git clone with https** command is the same. However, your terminal or shell might look different. Here’s a quick guide for various operating systems:

* **Windows**: Use Command Prompt or PowerShell.
    
* **Mac/Linux**: Use Terminal or a preferred shell like Zsh or Bash.
    

For all platforms, the cloning command will remain the same:

git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git

## **Conclusion**

Cloning a project from GitHub using HTTPS is a simple, secure, and effective method for developers at any skill level. Whether you're contributing to an open-source project or simply need a local copy of a repository, HTTPS provides a straightforward way to clone repositories without the need for additional configuration.

By following the steps outlined in this guide, you should be able to easily clone repositories and start working with the code in no time. Whether you choose HTTPS or SSH will depend on your preference and how often you need to access repositories. Both methods are secure, but HTTPS remains a user-friendly option for beginners.

## **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)**

### **1\. How do I clone a repository using HTTPS?**

To clone a repository using HTTPS, simply navigate to the repository on GitHub, copy the HTTPS URL, and use the following command in your terminal:

git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git

### **2\. Can I clone a private repository using HTTPS?**

Yes, you can. You’ll need to authenticate with your GitHub username and Personal Access Token (PAT) when cloning a private repository.

### **3\. What’s the difference between HTTPS and SSH cloning?**

HTTPS requires username and PAT for authentication and is simpler to set up, while SSH uses keys and is better suited for advanced users.

### **4\. How to resolve an authentication problem with HTTPS cloning?**

Make sure that you are using a valid GitHub username and Personal Access Token to authenticate. You can go into your GitHub settings and generate a new PAT.
