Databases are the backbone of modern applications, enabling efficient storage and retrieval of data. But have you ever wondered why databases like PostgreSQL don't simply use HTTP for communication? The answer lies in the specialized nature of database protocols.

The **PostgreSQL wire protocol** is specifically designed to handle complex database tasks such as transactions, secure authentication, and efficient data transfer. Unlike HTTP, which is stateless and optimized for web interactions, PostgreSQL’s wire protocol ensures persistent, long-lived connections that are crucial for client-server communication in database operations.

## **Why do we need a different protocol ??**

* **Optimized for Database Communication**: PostgreSQL wire protocol is tailored for database-specific operations, including query execution, transaction management, and high-concurrency workloads.
    
* **Persistent Connections**: Unlike HTTP, which focuses on stateless request-response cycles, the wire protocol supports long-lived connections, critical for high-performance databases.
    
* **Security and Efficiency**: By supporting advanced authentication mechanisms (e.g., MD5, SCRAM), the protocol enhances security while reducing overhead in client-server interactions.
    

## **Why are these types of protocols named "*wire*"?**

The term "wire protocol" highlights its role as the fundamental layer enabling communication between a database client and server. Just like signals transmitted over a physical wire, these protocols ensure seamless data exchange in the PostgreSQL ecosystem.

In this blog, we’ll explore the PostgreSQL wire protocol in depth, understand its architecture, message flow, and compare it with other approaches. We'll also discuss why PostgreSQL has emerged as a leader in the RDBMS space and the role its wire protocol plays in its success.

## PostgreSQL Ecosystem and Wire Protocol

The PostgreSQL wire protocol is the underlying mechanism that enables communication between a PostgreSQL client and server. It is a critical component of the PostgreSQL ecosystem, ensuring efficient and secure data exchange. In this blog post, we will dive into the technical aspects of the PostgreSQL wire protocol, exploring its architecture, and message flow, and how to see how different types of packets look like.

But First I want to draw your attention towards the massive growth Postgres as a db engine has made in the last decade. Let's discuss a few points as to why Postgres is now the most popular than other RDBMS which is InnoDB based such as MySQL. The first reason is of course license as PostgreSQL license is a liberal Open Source license similar to the BSD or MIT licenses. Another reason is that PostgreSQL's MVCC implementation excels in handling high contention and complex transactional scenarios. It provides strong support for concurrent read and write operations, making it suitable for [**OLTP**](https://www.oracle.com/in/database/what-is-oltp/#:~:text=What%20is%20OLTP%3F-,OLTP%20defined,sending%20text%20messages%2C%20for%20example.) *(Online Transaction Processing)* workloads.

The difference lies in their connection models. PostgreSQL uses a process-per-connection model, spawning a new process for each connection. MySQL, in contrast, uses a thread-per-connection model, spawning threads instead. Thus Postgres provides better isolation, e.g. an invalid memory access bug only crashes a single process instead of the entire database server. But on the other hand, this process model consumes more resources.

## How the PostgreSQL Wire Protocol Works

The PostgreSQL wire protocol is a TCP-based protocol that follows a client-server model. It operates on the principle of request-response cycles, where the client sends a request to the server, and the server responds accordingly. The protocol is designed to be extensible, allowing for new features and enhancements without breaking compatibility with existing clients and servers.

**Are there any HeartBeat calls for server health checks??**

So No PostgreSQL itself does not inherently have built-in "heartbeat" calls in the same way that some other systems or network protocols might have like MongoDB. This can be achieved using connection pooling tools like PgBouncer.

## Protocol Architecture

Like any other DB protocol postgres also has different types of packets containing various messages. Mainly they are of two types Startup packets and Regular data packets. Initial packets or startup packets are used in making database server connections with the client. They don't contain any query-related data it just provides connection parameters. So in this your client sends stuff like connection string and other attributes like protocol version, user, database, options, and application name, informing the server about client connection parameters. Upon receiving the startup packet, the server initializes the connection and session according to the specified parameters.

The "R" response type indicates the authentication mechanism supported by the server. By default, PostgreSQL versions before 14 support MD5 authentication, while version 14 and above support SCRAM authentication.

PostgreSQL uses authentication packets during connection setup to authorize clients for database access. The flow of authentication packets typically involves the following steps:

1. **Startup Message:** The client initiates the connection by sending a Startup Message to the server. This message includes the protocol version and connection parameters such as the database name and user name.
    
2. ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1714123583138/51311d27-0ae8-4f01-8ab3-33bb83c34ece.png align="center")
    
    **Authentication Request (Type 'R'):** In response to the Startup Message, the server sends an Authentication Request packet to the client. This packet indicates the authentication method required by the server. The authentication type is specified by a code in the packet, which can represent various methods such as plain text password, MD5, SCRAM-SHA-256, etc.
    
3. **Authentication Response:** Depending on the authentication method requested by the server, the client responds with an appropriate Authentication Response. For example:
    
    * If the server requests password authentication (code 3), the client sends a Password Message containing the plaintext password.
        
    * If the server requests MD5 authentication (code 5), the client sends a Password Message containing the MD5-hashed password and user name.
        
    * If the server requests SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication (code 10), a more complex exchange occurs, involving multiple messages to perform the SCRAM handshake. This includes the client sending a "**client-first-message**," the server responding with a "**server-first-message**", and so on until the authentication is either successful or fails.
        
4. **Authentication Completion:** If the authentication is successful, the server sends an AuthenticationOK message (code 0) to the client. If the authentication fails, the server sends an ErrorResponse message and typically closes the connection.
    
5. **Parameter Status and Backend Key Data (Optional):** After successful authentication, the server may send additional information such as *ParameterStatus* messages (which provide information about server parameters) and a *BackendKeyData* message (which provides a secret key for use in cancelling queries).
    
6. **ReadyForQuery:** Finally, the server sends a ReadyForQuery message, indicating that it is ready to receive SQL commands from the client.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1714123664832/269784c5-aec5-48ee-8cfd-b80c099f978d.png align="center")
    

Throughout this process, the client and server may exchange additional messages as required by the specific authentication method being used. The use of secure authentication methods like SCRAM-SHA-256 helps protect against various security threats such as **eavesdropping** and replay attacks.

Then comes the **Regular packets**, these messages take part in actual query execution once the authentication is established between client and server. regular messages between the client and server are structured as packets. A typical packet in the PostgreSQL wire protocol consists of the following components:

1. **Message Type (1 byte):** For most message types, this is a single ASCII character that identifies the type of message (e.g., 'Q' for a simple query, 'P' for the **Parse** message in the extended query protocol). Some messages, like the startup message, do not have a message type byte.
    
2. **Length (4 bytes):** This is an integer that specifies the length of the message, including the length field itself, but excluding the message type byte (if present). It is in network byte order (big-endian).
    
3. **Payload (variable length):** This is the actual content of the message, which varies depending on the message type. For example, in a simple query message ('Q'), the payload is a null-terminated string containing the SQL query.

The PostgreSQL wire protocol consists of three main phases:

1. **Startup Phase**: This phase establishes the connection between the client and server. The client sends a `StartupMessage` containing information such as the desired database, user name, and protocol version. The server responds with an `AuthenticationRequest`, which may prompt the client for password authentication or other authentication methods.
    
2. **Query Phase**: Once the connection is established, the client can send queries to the server. Queries are sent as `Query` messages, and the server executes the queries and returns the results in a series of messages, including `RowDescription`, `DataRow`, and `CommandComplete`.
    
3. **Termination Phase**: When the client is done with the connection, it sends a `Terminate` message to the server, which then closes the connection.
    

## Message Flow

The communication between the client and server is structured around a set of message types. Each message has a specific format and serves a distinct purpose. Some of the key message types include:

* **StartupMessage**: Initiates the connection and provides connection parameters.
    
* **AuthenticationRequest**: Requests authentication from the client.
    
* **Query**: Contains a SQL query to be executed by the server.
    
* **RowDescription**: Describes the format of the rows in the query result.
    
* **DataRow**: Contains the data for a single row of the query result.
    
* **CommandComplete**: Indicates the completion of a command.
    

## Handling Queries and Responses

When the client sends a `Query` message, the server parses and executes the query. The results are then sent back to the client in a series of messages. The `RowDescription` message provides metadata about the result set, such as the number of columns and their data types. This is followed by one or more `DataRow` messages, each containing the data for a single row. Finally, the `CommandComplete` message indicates that the query execution is complete.

## What are different types of Query Protocol?

In addition to the simple query protocol, PostgreSQL also supports an extended query protocol. This protocol allows for more advanced features, such as prepared statements and parameterized queries. In the extended protocol, the client sends a `Parse` message to prepare a statement and a `Bind` message to bind parameters to the statement. The server then executes the statement and returns the results like in the simple query protocol.

Two types of query execution: the ***Simple Query Protocol*** and the ***Extended Query Protocol***. Each has its own characteristics and use cases:

### **Simple Query Protocol**

* **Single-step process:** The client sends a single SQL statement to the server, and the server executes it and returns the result. This is done using the `QUERY` message.
    
* **No parameter binding:** The query is sent as a plain text string, and there is no support for parameterized queries. This means that values must be included directly in the query string, which can increase the risk of SQL injection if not handled properly.
    
* **No prepared statements:** The Simple Query Protocol does not support prepared statements, so the query is parsed and planned each time it is executed.
    
* **Simplicity:** It is easy to use for simple, ad-hoc queries where performance and security are not critical concerns.

### **Extended Query Protocol**

* **Multi-step process:** The Extended Query Protocol involves several steps: parsing the query (`PARSE` message), binding parameters to the parsed query (`BIND` message), executing the bound statement (`EXECUTE` message), and optionally describing the statement (`DESCRIBE` message).
    
* **Parameter binding:** It supports parameterised queries, where parameters are sent separately from the query text, reducing the risk of SQL injection.
    
* **Prepared statements:** The protocol supports prepared statements, which allows the server to parse, plan, and optimize a query once and then execute it multiple times with different parameters. This can improve performance for frequently executed queries.
    
* **More control and flexibility:** It provides more control over the execution of queries, such as specifying result formats, and is more suitable for complex applications that require higher performance and security.
    
* **Implementations by client:** In PostgreSQL's wire protocol, clients use unique identifiers for prepared statements (`Parse`) like `S_1`, `S_2`, etc per connection. I mean S\_1 can be mapped with a query like a `COMMIT` but the same S\_1 Identifier can be for a different query like `SELECT id, name FROM pets WHERE p1_0.owner_id = $1;` . This shows how each connection maintains an isolated internal state between the client and server.
    
* These statements are then bound with parameters (`Bind`) and executed (`Execute`) efficiently. This approach ensures secure and optimized SQL query execution between clients and servers, enhancing performance and flexibility in handling parameterized queries.

**When to use Simple Query Protocol vs. Extended Query Protocol?**

The decision to use the Extended Query Protocol (also known as "extended" mode) versus the Simple Query Protocol in PostgreSQL depends on the complexity and nature of the SQL commands being executed:

1. **Simple Query Protocol**:
    
    * **Use Case**: Ideal for executing single, standalone SQL commands that do not involve complex parameters or multiple-step transactions.
        
    * **Characteristics**: Sends a single SQL query string to the server and expects a response for each query executed.
        
    * **Example** - If you have manually created your queries without using any **ORM**(**Object Relational Mapper**) like Hibernate client will mostly use simple queries to retrieve data from the server.
        
2. **Extended Query Protocol**:
    
    * **Use Case**: Suited for more complex scenarios involving prepared statements, parameterized queries, or multi-step transactions.
        
    * **Characteristics**:
        
        * **Prepared Statements**: Allows preparing and caching SQL statements on the server for efficient reuse with different parameter values.
            
        * **Parameterized Queries**: Supports binding parameters to SQL statements for secure and efficient execution.
            
        * **Batch Processing**: Enables executing multiple SQL commands as part of a single transaction, reducing round-trips between the client and server.
            
    * **Example** - If you have a generalized lot of queries and most of them are similar it can be an overhead to execute it each time. Pg Clients can perform the prepared statements to execute the same (or similar) SQL statements repeatedly with high efficiency.
        

## Conclusion

The PostgreSQL wire protocol is a crucial component of the PostgreSQL ecosystem, enabling efficient and secure communication between clients and servers. Understanding the technical aspects of the protocol, from its architecture to its message flow, is essential for developers working with PostgreSQL. Whether you're building a new PostgreSQL client or optimizing an existing application, a deep understanding of the wire protocol will help you achieve better performance and reliability.

## **FAQs**

### **Why doesn’t PostgreSQL use HTTP for client-server communication?**

HTTP is a stateless protocol optimized for web interactions, whereas databases like PostgreSQL require a stateful protocol to handle long-lived connections, transactions, and secure authentication. The PostgreSQL wire protocol is specifically designed to meet these needs, providing persistent connections, efficient data transfer, and database-specific optimizations.

### **How does PostgreSQL ensure secure authentication over its wire protocol?**

PostgreSQL supports advanced authentication methods such as MD5 and SCRAM-SHA-256. SCRAM-SHA-256, introduced in PostgreSQL 10, offers robust security by avoiding plain-text password exchanges and using hashed values instead. Additionally, the protocol supports SSL/TLS to encrypt data transmitted between the client and server.

### **What is the difference between Simple Query Protocol and Extended Query Protocol in PostgreSQL?**

* **Simple Query Protocol:** Executes a single SQL statement at a time without parameter binding or prepared statements. It is straightforward and suited for simple, ad-hoc queries.
    
* **Extended Query Protocol:** Involves multiple steps like parsing, binding parameters, and execution. It supports prepared statements and parameterized queries, which reduce SQL injection risks and improve performance for repetitive queries.
