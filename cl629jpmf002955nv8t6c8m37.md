During one of my internships, I came to know about API testing which was a hectic job, along with so many difficulties and frustrations. So I decided to find out several kinds of difficulties that are faced during the testing process which are mentioned below.

## Technical Difficulties

1. ### Wrong Rest API Parameter
    

Generally, an API consists of many parameters, where the purpose of the API parameter is to pass data values through the API endpoint according to the data request. Choosing the wrong REST API parameter combinations can trigger faulty program states that might potentially expose APIs to external attacks or cause crashes.

2. ### Faulty sequencing of the API calls
    

In some cases, API needs to be arranged in the proper sequence to function properly. Let’s take an example of a web app where a person can create his profile and can delete his profile, Now let’s say if the testing team tests the profile deletion feature before the profile creating feature then the tester will be getting an undesired response. So, an unordered sequence of APIs creates a mess for testers.

3. ### Not validating REST API parameter
    

It is important to validate the API parameters because a malicious attacker might call the API with parameters that don’t fit the expected data type or value ranges.

4. ### Not maintaining the Data Formatting
    

In API testing, data formatting describes the schema that specifies how data is formatted, since this schema handles responses and requests of REST APIs, it has to be maintained and updated regularly to ensure that newly added parameters are included in the schema.

5. ### Difficulty in setting up an Automated REST API Test
    

The initial configuration is the part of automated REST API testing that requires the most manual effort.

6. ### REST API Error Reporting
    

Conventional black box testing tools can’t measure the test coverage during REST API testing, which greatly reduces the value of test reports. white-box testing approaches enable testers to generate inputs that cover large parts of REST APIs, While providing details error reports and code-coverage visibility.

7. ### System integration
    

It is important to make sure that the API system works properly with the data tracking system. For example, a shipment platform that uses shipment tracking API tracks all the information across the available carriers and the outside platform. Here we need to validate all responses to ensure that call is working properly. This information is used to measure the API performance.

8. ### Initial setup of API Testing
    

Getting the testing infrastructure up and running is often one of the most challenging parts of the process not because it is difficult but because it can be a motivation killer.

9. ### Updating of API request testing scheme
    

The data format that handles requests and responses for the API — needs to be maintained throughout the testing process. Any update to the program that creates additional parameters for the API calls need to be reflected in the schema configuration.

## Theoretical Problems

1. ### Limited Time
    

Generally, testers get less time for testing as compared to developers, which becomes hectic for testers to give the best output.

2. ### Communication gap
    

Many bugs arise while the testing process, which interrupts the testing flow therefore proper communication is important between developers and testers.

3. ### Poor API Documentation
    

Poor documentation creates a lot of difficulties for testers in understanding the code.

4. ### Building flow is challenging
    

Building flow while testing requires proper coordination between the testing team and the developer team.

## Conclusion

API testing can be challenging due to various technical and theoretical difficulties. Key technical challenges include securing API parameters, sequencing API calls, validating parameters, maintaining data formatting, setting up automated tests, error reporting, system integration, initial setup, and updating request schemes. Theoretical challenges involve limited testing time, communication gaps, poor documentation, and the difficulty of building testing flows. Proper coordination and thorough understanding are essential to overcome these hurdles.
