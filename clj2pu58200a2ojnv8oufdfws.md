In recent years, GraphQL has gained significant traction as a powerful alternative to traditional RESTful APIs. Developed by Facebook, GraphQL offers a more flexible and efficient way to query and manipulate data. In this blog post, we will delve into the fundamentals of GraphQL, its advantages, and how to implement GraphQL APIs.

### Let's first understand what is GraphQL

![Graphql VS Rest API](https://blog.logrocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/graphql-rest-api.png align="center")

GraphQL is a query language and server-side runtime for application programming interfaces (APIs) that prioritizes giving clients exactly the data they request and no more.

GraphQL is designed to make APIs fast, flexible, and developer-friendly. It can even be deployed within an [integrated development environment (IDE)](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/middleware/what-is-ide) known as [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql). As an alternative to [REST](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/api/what-is-a-rest-api), GraphQL lets developers construct requests that pull data from multiple data sources in a single API call.

Additionally, GraphQL gives API maintainers the flexibility to add or deprecate fields without impacting existing queries. Developers can build APIs with whatever methods they prefer, and the GraphQL specification will ensure they function in predictable ways to clients.

### GraphQL common terms

* SCHEMA - API developers use GraphQL to create a **schema** to describe all the possible data that clients can query through that service.  A GraphQL **schema** is made up of object types, which define which kind of object you can request and what fields it has.
    
* QUERIES - As **queries** come in, GraphQL validates the queries against the schema. GraphQL then executes the validated queries.
    
* RESOLVER - The API developer attaches each field in a schema to a function called a **resolver**. During execution, the resolver is called to produce the value.

## **When should you use GraphQL?**

GraphQL is an excellent solution to a unique problem around the building and consuming APIs. When used as designed, it can be an ideal tool for the use cases described below:

### **Data fetching control**

* GraphQL was designed to allow the client to ask for only the data it needs. While the server might be able to deliver more data to the client for a single request, it would only send the data requested by the client. If you want the client to control the type and amount of data it needs, GraphQL would be ideal for your project.
    

### **Using multiple data sources**

* GraphQL simplifies the task of aggregating data from multiple sources or APIs and then resolving the data to the client in a single API call. On the other hand, API technologies like REST would require multiple HTTP calls to access data from multiple sources.
    

### **Alleviating bandwidth concerns**

* Bandwidth is a problem for small devices like mobile phones, smartwatches, and IoT devices that are not able to handle large amounts of data. Using GraphQL helps minimize this issue. Because GraphQL allows the client to specify what data it needs, the server doesn’t send excess data, which could reduce the app’s performance when bandwidth is limited.
    

### **Rapid prototyping**

* GraphQL exposes a single endpoint that allows you to access multiple resources. In addition, resources are not exposed according to the views that you have inside your app. So, if your UI changes, for example, requiring either more or less data, it doesn’t have an impact or require changes on the server.
    

Let's take a look at the difference between requests made in **REST API vs GraphQL**

## Advantages and Disadvantages of GraphQL

Here's a comparison table highlighting the key differences of GraphQL vs REST, followed by guidelines on when to use each approach.


| Feature              | GraphQL                                            | REST                                                |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Fetching**    | Allows clients to request specific data fields     | Returns fixed data structure for each endpoint      |
| **Flexibility**      | High - clients can request exactly what they need  | Low - clients receive pre-defined responses         |
| **Versioning**       | Typically doesn't require versioning               | Often uses versioning in endpoint URLs (e.g., /v1/) |
| **Over-fetching**    | Avoided by querying specific fields                | Common due to fixed responses                       |
| **Under-fetching**   | Avoided by querying specific fields                | Common, may require multiple endpoints to get all data |
| **Performance**      | Single request can fetch data from multiple resources | Multiple requests for different resources          |
| **Learning Curve**   | Steeper learning curve                             | Generally easier to learn                           |
| **Tooling**          | Requires specialized tools (e.g., GraphQL clients) | Widely supported with many existing tools          |
| **Error Handling**   | Single response with detailed error information    | Separate error responses for each request          |
| **Caching**          | More complex due to dynamic queries                | Easier with HTTP caching mechanisms (e.g., ETags)  |
| **Real-time Updates**| Supports subscriptions for real-time data          | Requires additional setup (e.g., WebSockets, SSE)  |
| **Schema**           | Strongly typed schema defines data and relationships | Loose schema, often documented separately         |
| **Community**        | Growing, strong support from major companies       | Mature, well-established, and broadly adopted      |


## GraphQL and Open Source

GraphQL was developed by Facebook, which first began using it for mobile applications in 2012. The GraphQL specification was open-sourced in 2015. It is now overseen by the [GraphQL Foundation](https://foundation.graphql.org/).

There are a variety of open-source projects that involve GraphQL. The list below is not exhaustive but includes projects designed to facilitate the adoption of GraphQL.

* [Apollo](https://github.com/apollographql), a GraphQL platform that includes a frontend client library ([Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/client/)) and backend server framework ([Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/server/)).
    
* [Offix](https://github.com/aerogear/offix) is an offline client that allows GraphQL mutations and queries to execute even when an application is unreachable.
    
* [Graphback](https://github.com/aerogear/graphback), a command line client for generating GraphQL-enabled Node.js servers.
    
* [OpenAPI-to-GraphQL](https://github.com/IBM/openapi-to-graphql), a command-line interface and library for translating APIs described by OpenAPI Specifications or Swagger into GraphQL.
    

## Conclusion

GraphQL is a powerful tool, and there are many reasons you might choose GraphQL over REST. But, if your tolerance for slow performance and complexity is low, you might want to steer clear and consider using a REST architecture instead.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are the main differences between GraphQL vs REST?

GraphQL allows clients to request specific fields, avoiding over-fetching and under-fetching. It typically doesn't require versioning and can fetch data from multiple sources in one request. REST has fixed responses, often uses versioning, and may need multiple requests for related data.

### When should I choose GraphQL over REST?

Choose GraphQL when your application requires complex queries, client-specific data needs, rapid iteration without breaking changes, or real-time updates. It is also beneficial to avoid over-fetching and under-fetching by letting clients fetch only the data they need.

### What are the advantages of REST over GraphQL?

REST is simpler for basic CRUD operations, effectively leverages HTTP caching, and has a mature ecosystem with established best practices. It is stateless, making it easier to scale horizontally, and widely adopted, ensuring broad expertise and support.

### How does error handling differ between GraphQL vs REST?

GraphQL returns a single response with data and detailed error information, allowing partial success. REST uses HTTP status codes with separate error responses for each failed request, providing a more uniform but potentially more fragmented error handling approach.

### Is GraphQL more secure than REST?

GraphQL offers fine-grained data control but requires careful implementation of authorization and rate limiting to prevent abuse. REST relies on well-understood HTTP methods and status codes. Both can be secure if implemented correctly, though GraphQL's flexibility needs more attention to detail.
