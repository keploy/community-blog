The world of software development is constantly evolving, and with it, the roles in software testing have transformed. Gone are the days when testing was only about manually clicking through user interfaces. Today, automation, DevOps, and continuous testing drive the industry, making roles like **Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET)** more crucial than ever.

If you've ever wondered what an SDET is, how they differ from traditional QA testers and test engineers, and how their salaries compare, this blog is for you. Let's break it all down.

## **What Is an SDET?**

A Software Development Engineer in Test **(SDET)** is a specialized professional who blends software development and testing expertise. Unlike a traditional tester who primarily focuses on executing test cases, an SDET actively contributes to test automation, framework development, and software quality assurance at the code level.

### **Key Responsibilities of an SDET**

SDETs wear multiple hats in the software development lifecycle (SDLC). Here are some of their primary responsibilities:

* **Test Automation Development** – Writing test scripts, developing automation frameworks, and integrating automated tests into CI/CD pipelines.
    
* **Collaboration with Developers** – Working closely with software engineers to review code, suggest improvements, and ensure testability.
    
* **API and Performance Testing** – Verifying backend APIs, load testing, and ensuring that software meets performance benchmarks.
    
* **Security Testing** – Identifying security vulnerabilities in code and ensuring compliance with security best practices.
    
* **DevOps and Continuous Testing** – Integrating testing into DevOps processes, ensuring automated tests run in CI/CD pipelines for faster releases.
    
* **Test Environment Setup** – Managing test environments, setting up virtual machines, and ensuring smooth test execution.
    

Unlike a traditional QA Tester, who mainly executes tests, reports bugs, and validates fixes, an SDET focuses on **developing robust automation solutions** to reduce manual testing efforts.

## **SDET vs. Test Engineer vs. QA Tester**

The terms **SDET, Test Engineer, and QA Tester** are often used interchangeably, but they have distinct roles. Let's break down the differences:

### **1\. QA Tester**

A **QA Tester** is [responsible for manual testing](https://keploy.io/blog/community/why-manual-testing-matters-a-ultimate-guide-to-software-testing), executing test cases, and validating software functionality. They:

* Write and execute **manual test cases**.
    
* Identify and report bugs.
    
* Perform regression, functional, and exploratory testing.
    
* Have **limited coding knowledge** (if any).
    
* Rely on automation tools built by others.
    

QA testers ensure the **end-user experience** is smooth but typically do not write automation scripts or interact with code extensively.

### **2\. Test Engineer**

A **Test Engineer** is a step ahead of a QA Tester and often works with test automation but may not have the same development skills as an SDET. They:

* Perform **manual and automated testing**.
    
* Have experience with [automation tools like Cypress](https://keploy.io/blog/community/playwright-vs-cypress-choosing-the-best-e2e-testing-framework), Selenium or JUnit.
    
* Focus on test execution and maintenance rather than framework development.
    
* Identify software quality issues but may not contribute significantly to fixing them.
    

Test Engineers are crucial for automation testing but may lack the depth of programming knowledge required to develop complex testing frameworks.

### **3\. Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET)**

An **SDET** is a hybrid role that combines software development and testing expertise. They:

* Write test automation frameworks from scratch.
    
* Develop custom testing tools to improve test efficiency.
    
* Work on **unit testing, API testing, performance testing, and security testing**.
    
* Have strong **coding skills in languages like Java, Python, JavaScript, or C#**.
    
* Work closely with DevOps engineers for **continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD)**.
    

## **Key Difference Between an SDET and a QA Tester/Test Engineer**

| **Feature** | **QA Tester** | **Test Engineer** | **SDET** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Testing Type | Manual | Manual & Automated | Automated & Development |
| Coding Knowledge | Little to none | Basic | Strong |
| Test Automation | Uses existing tools | Writes scripts | Builds frameworks |
| Collaboration | Works with developers | Works with developers | Works with developers & DevOps |
| Security & Performance Testing | Limited | Some | Extensive |
| Focus | Finding bugs | Automating tests | Developing test solutions |

An **SDET is essentially a developer who tests software** rather than just a tester who executes tests.

## **Why Are SDETs in High Demand?**

Companies today aim for **faster releases, higher code quality, and reduced testing time**. This is where SDETs shine.

### **1\. The Shift to Test Automation**

Manual testing is slow and error-prone. Businesses rely on **automated testing** to speed up releases, making SDETs a critical part of Agile and DevOps teams.

### **2\. CI/CD and DevOps Integration**

Since SDETs understand both coding and testing, they help integrate testing in CI/CD pipelines, ensuring rapid and reliable software releases.

### **3\. Cost-Effectiveness**

Instead of hiring separate developers and testers, companies prefer **SDETs who can write tests and debug code**, reducing overall development costs.

### **4\. Enhanced Software Quality**

SDETs **prevent bugs at the development stage** rather than just finding them after deployment, improving overall software reliability.

## **SDET Salary: How Much Do They Earn?**

The demand for Software Development Engineers in Test (SDETs) has grown significantly as companies move toward test automation, DevOps, and continuous testing. This shift has led to a significant pay gap between traditional Software Testers and SDETs. If you’re currently in a manual testing role or even working as a Test Engineer, you might be wondering:

* How much more do SDETs make compared to traditional testers?
    
* What skills can increase a tester’s salary?
    
* How can you transition from a tester to an SDET?
    

Let’s break it all down.

### **Factors Affecting SDET Salaries**

1. **Experience** – More years of experience means higher pay.
    
2. **Tech Stack** – SDETs skilled in **Python, Java, Selenium, Kubernetes, and cloud technologies** earn more.
    
3. **Company** – Big tech companies like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft pay higher salaries.
    
4. **Certifications** – Certifications in **AWS, Azure, Kubernetes, or performance testing** boost salary potential.
    

### Salary Comparison

According to Payscale, the national average **salary for an SDET is $88,000 per year**, while a **Software Tester earns an average of $55,501 per year**. That’s a difference of over $32,000 annually!

If we look at salary trends in the UK, the job board ItJobsWatch shows a similar trend, where SDETs earn considerably more than traditional testers.

| **Role** | **Average Salary (USA)** | **Average Salary (UK)** | **Average Salary (India)** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Software Tester | $55,501/year | £35,000/year | ₹5-10 LPA |
