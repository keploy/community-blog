Whether for frontend or backend, testing is a key aspect of building **trustworthy** JavaScript applications. For example, when writing code that relies on external modules or services such as **APIs, databases**, or configuration providers, mocking can allow for a more isolated testing structure without those real dependencies.

If you are using Jest, one of the most popular JavaScript testing frameworks, then you may have seen the term mock. In this blog, weâ€™ll define what **mocking** actually means, provide clarification on how and when it is useful, discuss the various options for mocking available to us using Jest, and **outline a real** example of how to use a mock of a provider correctly.

## What is a Mock?

Suppose you have code you want to test that sends messages using a messaging application. Now, for the purposes of testing, you don't really want to send actual messages whenever you're running the test - that would be costly, time-consuming, and unnecessary. And that is where mocks enter the scene.

![Real vs Mock Function](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1754302147001/49b0ffe2-fca5-4aae-a7e5-401ed20cdd34.png align="center")

A [**mock**](https://keploy.io/blog/community/mastering-mocking-a-complete-guide-to-mocks-and-other-test-doubles) is the same as an in-place imposter of the actual one. Rather than invoking the real function (such as sending an actual message, making a live API call, or invoking a database), you invoke a **false one** that acts similarly - close enough for your test to execute.

This assists you:

* To concentrate on the functionality of your code you are testing
    
* Not to have external dependencies (such as network or database)
    
* Make the mock be whatever you want so you can test under a million different scenarios
    
* Make your tests execute quicker and pass more frequently
    

**So in short:** Mocks enable you to test smarter by pretending to be the real thing - minus all the side effects.

## Why Use a Mock?

![why use mock](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1754562885862/947749bb-0b59-4673-92f9-7a4b89a06d20.png align="left")

Mocking is helpful for:

### 1\. **Isolating components**

When you are writing tests for one part of your app, you do not want other parts to interfere. For instance, if you are testing how your app will handle users logging in, you don't want the database, email service, or payment system in the way. **Mocks allow you to test just the piece you care about**, by substituting all the extra stuff with simple, controlled versions.

### 2\. **Speeding up tests**

Real-world actions such as calling an API or accessing a database take time - sometimes multiple seconds. Do that dozens or hundreds of times, and everything gets slow. **Mocks eliminate those pauses** by simulating the response on the fly, so your tests run **lightning-fast**.

### 3\. **Controlling behavior**

With mocks, you have complete control over what the function returns. Want to mock an API to respond with an error? Or see how your code will behave with no data? **You can control precisely what the mock does**, so it is simple to test all sorts of scenarios - good, bad, or wacky - without having to rely on a real system to go haywire.

### 4\. **Tracking function calls**

Mocks can also be used like spies. They don't simply mimic the actual function - they **recall**:

* How many times they were invoked
    
* What arguments they were invoked with
    
* If they were invoked at all  
    This is really handy when you want to verify: "Did my function do what I thought it should do?"
    

## Automated Mocking with Keploy

![Automated Mocking with Keploy ](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1757314439912/ae058d07-b6d7-4f82-9b61-4c2fafa4ab59.jpeg align="center")

Although Jest has powerful manual mocking functions (`jest.fn`, `jest.mock`, `jest.spyOn`), mocks can become a chore to write and maintain when dealing with APIs, a database, or a third-party service.

This is where Keploy is useful. Keploy is an OSS tool that records real API and database requests and responses during an applicationâ€™s run-time to automatically generate **mocks** for your tests. Instead of creating mocks for each provider, with Keploy you can:

* Record the actual requests and responses within your typical dev cycle.
    
* Automatically generate mocks (YAML files) from those actual requests and responses.
    
* Replay the mocks in your Jest tests resulting in deterministic, reliable tests.
    

**Example: Auto-Mock an API with Keploy**

Let's say you have a `getData()` function that makes a fetch request to an API:

```javascript
// utils.js
export const getData = async () => {
  const res = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
  return res.json();
};
```

You would typically do something like

```javascript
jest.mock("../utils", () => ({
  getData: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({ id: 1, name: "John" }),
}));
```

With **Keploy**, instead of having to type in this mock you run your app along with Keploy and it records the API interaction:

```bash
Sudo env "PATH=$PATH" keploy record -c "npm start"
```

![Keploy Record](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1760007304107/f23c6e69-7c41-4db2-8299-d6d2c467338a.png align="center")

Keploy generates a test case (YAML **representation**):

```yaml
version: api.keploy.io/v1beta1
kind: Http
spec:
  req:
    url: "https://api.example.com/data"
    method: GET
  res:
    status: 200
    body: '{"id":1,"name":"John"}'
```

**And then next** time, you run your Jest tests:

```bash
sudo env "PATH=$PATH" keploy test -c "npm start"
```

![Keploy Test](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1760007338478/85d58387-634f-4b90-8d3f-263c3b8589de.png align="center")

[Keploy](https://keploy.io/) **will** automatically **mock** the API call **so it uses** the **expected** response.

* No manual mocks.
    
* Consistency of when the tests are invoked.
    
* Works across APIs, DBs, and micro services.
    

## Jest Mock Methods â€“ Simplified

Jest makes testing incredibly strong by allowing you to simulate (mock) pieces of your code. Let's examine the most popularly used mock methods, and what they actually signify:

### ðŸ”¹ `jest.fn()` â€“ **B**uild a mock function from scratch

Imagine building with a clean sheet. You build an imitation function that you can make up as you wish.  
This is ideal when you just want a simple function for your test - no actual logic, just something to "stand in".

**Example use case:**  
You have a button click handler you want to test without committing it to any actual business logic yet.

```powershell
const mockClickHandler = jest.fn();
button.onClick = mockClickHandler;
```

### `jest.mock()` â€“ Mock a whole module automatically

This is like saying to Jest: "Hey, pretend everything within this file or package for me. It automatically substitutes all exports from such a module with mocks.

**Example use case:**  
You're importing an API helper file (`api.js`) and don't want it to actually call the internet when testing

```powershell
jest.mock('./api');
```

Now all functions in `api.js` are substituted with mocks.

### ðŸ”¹ `jest.spyOn()` â€“ Observe (spy on) an actual function

At times, you might need to use the original function, but also monitor it - such as how many times it's being called, or with what arguments. That's what `spyOn()` does. It's like creating a secret camera on a function.

**Example use case:**  
You'd like to test whether `console.log` was called without altering how it's called

```powershell
const spy = jest.spyOn(console, 'log');
myFunction();
expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalled();
```

![Jest spy](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1754552127134/1b5df95d-05ac-4b5f-8414-2b942ad5eb5b.png align="center")

### ðŸ”¹ `mockImplementation()` â€“ Set up custom behavior for the mock

With this approach, you can make your mock function behave exactly the way you want..

**Example use case:**  
Mock an API call that returns varying values based on input.

```javascript
const mockFn = jest.fn().mockImplementation((user) => {
  return user === 'admin' ? 'Welcome' : 'Access denied';
});
```

![Admin Result](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1754554019209/a536be7b-ff2b-4e87-becc-176bfa1b9f39.png align="center")

![Guest Result](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1754554068135/5842df01-2700-41b7-91e2-d192825c60c0.png align="center")

### ðŸ”¹ `mockReturnValue()` - Return a constant value each time

If you don't require sophisticated behavior, and you simply want your mock to always return the same result, this is the most elegant solution.

**Example use case:**  
Mock a function which consistently returns `true`.

```powershell
const mockFn = jest.fn().mockReturnValue(true);
```

![Mock Return Value](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1754556354114/3e6d506c-e25d-4fdd-b2b5-b01f8344c35e.png align="center")

### ðŸ”¹ `mockResolvedValue()` â€“ Return a resolved Promise (for async mocks)

Great for `async` functions or functions returning Promises. Rather than writing `.then()` chains, you simply instruct Jest what the outcome should be.

**Example use case:**  
You wish to mock a call to `fetchData()` which would otherwise return JSON from an API

```powershell
const mockFetch = jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({ id: 1, name: 'John' });
```

## Jest Mocking Techniques â€“ Theory and Practical Examples Described

### **1\. Simple Module Mocking**

#### **Theory**

When testing a function or a component, you should test something all at once. If your code calls a helper or utility function in another module, invoking the actual function might result in:

* Unwanted side effects (e.g., making network requests)
    
* Test failure due to problems beyond code you're testing
    
* Slower tests.
    

**Mocking allows you to substitute actual functions with mock ones**, and you can decide what they do during your test execution.

#### Example

```javascript
Edit// utils.js
export const getData = () => {
  return fetch("/data").then(res => res.json());
};
```

Test file:

```javascript
jest.mock("../utils", () => ({
  getData: jest.fn(),
}));

import { getData } from "../utils";

test("should call getData", () => {
  // Mock return value
  getData.mockReturnValue({ name: "John" });

  // Call the function (this is required, otherwise .toHaveBeenCalled() fails)
  const result = getData();

  // Assert it was called
  expect(getData).toHaveBeenCalled();
  expect(result).toEqual({ name: "John" });
});
```

```bash
PASS  __tests__/utils.test.js
  âœ“ should call getData (5 ms)
```

**Why this matters:**

You wrap code to be tested and get it working regardless of what `getData` does internally

### **2.** Advanced Module Mocking (Mocking Providers & Hooks)

![Simple and Advanced Mocking](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1754563605071/18cb03a2-f0c5-4d4c-8938-656be0e5d594.png align="center")

#### **Theory**

The majority of new applications (especially React) use context providers, hooks, or state management libraries. Mocking them is important because:

* They often depend on global app state or browser APIs.
    
* You might need to mock different contexts (e.g., dark mode, or different user roles).
    
* Real providers can return side effects, which we don't want to occur within unit tests.
    

#### Example

```javascript
// themeProvider.js
export const useTheme = () => {
  return { darkMode: true };
};
```

Mock it in your test:

```javascript
// __mocks__/themeProvider.js
export const useTheme = jest.fn();
```

Then:

```javascript
jest.mock("../themeProvider");
import { useTheme } from "../themeProvider";

useTheme.mockReturnValue({ darkMode: false });

test("should render in light mode", () => {
  // render component
  // assert light mode UI
});
```

```bash
 PASS  path/to/your/testfile.test.js
  âœ“ should render in light mode (5 ms)
```

**Why this matters:**  
It enables you to experiment with how your component is going to behave in a given case without depending on actual implementations.

### **3\. Using a Mock Function**

#### **Theory**

Jest enables you to utilize the `jest.fn()`function to **create custom mock functions.** These mock functions allow you to:

* Simulate behavior
    
* Catch how and when they were called,
    
* Not have to provide an actual implementation.
    

This is the basis of mocking in Jest.

#### Example

```javascript
const mockFn = jest.fn();

mockFn("hello", 42);

expect(mockFn).toHaveBeenCalledWith("hello", 42);
```

![Mock Function](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1754551834233/655572ee-c771-4af5-a31a-695f7936bd3c.png align="center")

**Why this matters:**  
It's perfect for testing callbacks, event listeners, or dependency injections - whenever you just need a fake function to watch.

### **4\. Mock Return Values**

#### **Theory**

Sometimes you merely need a mock function to return **pre-programmed results.** That's where `mockReturnValue()` and `mockReturnValueOnce()` are useful.  
They enable you:

* To mock a fixed response (e.g. API success)
    
* To generate **sequences** of results (e.g. retry examples).
    

#### Example

```javascript
const fetchUser = jest.fn();

fetchUser.mockReturnValue({ id: 1, name: "John" });

expect(fetchUser()).toEqual({ id: 1, name: "John" });
```

Sequential mocks:

```javascript
fetchUser.mockReturnValueOnce("First").mockReturnValueOnce("Second");
```

![Mock Return](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1754551979020/a4e77918-927e-48ad-b123-e04680de4bc4.png align="center")

**Why this matters:**

It allows you to mock various real-world responses **without actually relying on actual APIs.**

### **5\. Mocking Modules with** `jest.mock()`

#### **Theory**

When testing third-party libraries (such as Axios, Firebase, Stripe), you do not want to make real services calls.`jest.mock()` instructs Jest to **replace a whole module** with a mocked module.  
You can then tell the mocked module what to respond like.

#### Example

```javascript
jest.mock("axios");
import axios from "axios";

axios.get.mockResolvedValue({ data: { id: 123 } });
```

**Why this matters:**

It prevents you from making **real HTTP requests** in the process of testing, which makes your tests run faster and be more reliable.

### **6\. Mock Implementations**

#### **Theory**

When return values are insufficient, `mockImplementation()` to **specify the implementation within the mock**.  
This leaves room for maneuvering to mimic the way the function responds to various conditions.

#### Example

```javascript
const logger = jest.fn().mockImplementation((msg) => {
  return `Logged: ${msg}`;
});
```

![Admin Result](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1754554019209/a536be7b-ff2b-4e87-becc-176bfa1b9f39.png align="left")

**Why it is important:**

It must be used when the functioning of the function is critical, or when the need to cause dynamic effects depends on information.

### **7\. Automatic Mocking**

#### **Theory**

In Jest, you can find a similar file in the `__mocks__` directory. If you have a mock faculty position in `__mocks__/`, Jest will use the mock spontaneously when you use `jest.mock()`.  
**Directory Structure:**

```powershell
project-root/
â”œâ”€â”€ utils.js
â””â”€â”€ __mocks__/
    â””â”€â”€ utils.js
```

In your test:

```javascript
jest.mock("../utils"); // Automatically uses __mocks__/utils.js
```

**Why this is useful :**  
It's ideal for large codebases where multiple test files have the same mocked behavior.

### **8\. Manual Mocking**

#### **Theory**

Manual mocking enables you to declare mock objects or beliefs directly in your trial file. It is very convenient for constants, configuration files, or environment variables when you execute a mock file that does not require a packed mock file.

#### Example

```javascript
jest.mock("../config", () => ({
  API_URL: "https://mocked-url.com",
}));
```

![Manual mock url](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1754556060335/2c1a2897-6d20-46ac-8339-61e774e2417f.png align="center")

![manual mock api key](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1754556096974/2f4274cc-98cf-4881-a2a3-66e8eac597fe.png align="center")

**Why this is important:**  
It's fast, it's tidy, and perfect for mocking constants or one-off configurations.

## Conclusion

It is important to familiarize yourself with `jest mock` methods in an attempt to write **dependable**, **efficient**, and unit tests independently for JavaScript applications. From easy utility functions to heavy providers like **context APIs** or **external modules**, Jest boasts a robust and flexible mock system that will meet the majority of testing requirements.

By being able to **mock a provider**, **return values**, and fake behavior, you make your components testable in isolation - regardless of actual dependencies or side effects. Not only does this make your tests more reliable but debugging and maintenance much more convenient. So next time you're writing a test, don't hesitate to mock smart - **your future debugging self will appreciate it**

## FAQs

### 1\. Whatâ€™s a mock in Jest?

A mockery is basically a fake version of something, such as a function, faculty, or perhaps a service, which you use in a trial rather than the real thing. This helps to keep your trial predictable and independent since you can control the way the mock trial is performed and see which method it is second best acquainted with.

### 2\. How do I mock a provider in Jest?

To replace the actual faculty or function with a mock version, you can use `jest.mock()`. Then, if you want to return exact data for your trial, use approaches such as `mockReturnValue()` or `mockImplementation()` to determine how the mock behaves.

### 3\. Whatâ€™s the difference between `jest.fn()` and `jest.mock()`?

`jest.fn()` creates a unique mock function which is very useful when you want to test recall accuracy, else a little logic. `jest.mock()` replaces the entire faculty otherwise file, which is more useful for integration-style testing where you want to mock complete the dependency at one time.

### 4\. Can Jest mock async functions?

Yes! Jest owns `mockResolvedValue()` and `mockRejectedValue()` to imitate commitments settlement alternatively reject. The present will be helpful if you are testing a code that uses a name database, APIs, or another async support.

### 5\. Is manual mocking better than automatic mocking?

The manual mock gives you more control and is very useful if you've got complicated logic to test it, as long as you know exactly how the mock behaves. However, there might never be a machine mock that is easy to set up and yet flexible enough to be used in slippery trial situations.
